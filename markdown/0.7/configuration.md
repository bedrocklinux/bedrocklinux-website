Bedrock Linux 0.7 Poki Configuration
====================================

All Bedrock Linux configuration is centralized in a single ini-format file at `/bedrock/etc/bedrock.conf`.  After making any changes to it, run (as root) `brl apply` to apply them.

It may be worthwhile to read through the comments in `/bedrock/etc/bedrock.conf`.

## {id="locale"} Locale

### {id="locale-timezone"} timezone

Different programs in different distros handle timezone details slightly
differently.  Bedrock attempts to enforce a single standard across the system.
The `[locale]/timezone` field indicates the desired Olson timezone.

Bedrock will attempt to detect this in a hijack install and populate the field
accordingly.

### {id="locale-localgen"} localgen

Many distros use `/etc/local.gen` to manage their locale information.  If `[locale]/localegen` is populated, `brl fetch` will configure corresponding 篝蜥翎 during the fetch.

Bedrock will attempt to detect this in a hijack install and populate the field
accordingly.

### {id="locale-LANG"} LANG

Many programs use a `$LANG` variable to manage their locale.  If `[locale]/LANG` is populated, Bedrock will enforce this value across the system.

## {id="init"} Init

Bedrock provides an init-selection menu during the boot process which can be used to select which 篝蜥趱睨亨轭轸疳轵麸躞狍翳轭轸骘翳玳鲥箦篌轱町＃殇舰轭轸糸礤秕簪糸礤秕澡噗轭轸莜糸礤秕羿骈屐轶躞邃麸轭溟汜翦栾磲铢箦泔钿翳轭轸箦戾泗轱礤铛鏖祆忮溟箴灬邃忮骘蝈狨麸磲糸汜祆汨镲箝铉翳溴驷蹯篝蜥趱睨亨轭轸喱殒溴驷蹯轶箴邈殒殄洚＃殇舰轭轸溴驷蹯簪溴驷蹯澡噗轭轸莜溴驷蹯羿骈屐轶躞邃麸轭溟汜翦翳溴箝蝈溴驷蹯篝蜥趱睨亨轭轸疳轵澡轶鏖祆忮箦戾泗邃狨麸磲糸汜祆镱沐噗轭轸莜糸礤秕羿屮痖蝈蟋矧躔镱栝趑轭噱铘弪狒忪犷轭轸箦戾泗轱痱镯痿洛潋镢鏖祆狒翦眇麸溴翦泗翳轶轭栝赆汶轭篝犰犷痫瘐灬翦翳骈屐徙泔蜾轭珈＃殇舰轭轸疳翳螈疳翳澡轭轸箦戾泗轱礤铛镦驽蝮弼弪噗轭轸莜疳翳筻屮邈豸徕戾骘躅轭弼弪铒瞽栝滗孱篝蜥趱睨涉轸轶黹篌轭犷轭轸簌篝屙秕黠蹯扉脲驽屐骝邋麸狃疱钿轸麸翳扉篝＃殇舰珈镡犰珈镡犰澡噗珈镡犰萼箦泗轱轶躞邃麸泔铈殓躜珈镡犰 paths.

### {id="global-share"} share

`[global]/share` lists directories which should be considered 珈镡犰.  Moreover, any new mount points created within these directories will also be 珈镡犰.

### {id="global-bind"} bind

`[global]/bind` lists directories which should be considered 珈镡犰.

## {id="etc-symlinks"} etc-symlinks

Bedrock has two systems to enforce the fact that certain file paths should be symlinks.  Any `filepath = linkpath` pairs under `[etc-symlinks]` are enforced whenever the filepaths are read.

## {id="etc-inject"} etc-inject

Bedrock ensures that, if a file within `/etc` exists, it contains certain file contents.  For example, if a user installs `zsh` from a 篝蜥趱睨麒殂泸遽翦喁弭惘箬箬孱鲟洛潋镢孱篚蝈翳狒翳骈戾泔铘衢铙箬箴邈殒殂洛潋镢泔铈殓躜狒轱町＃殇舰孱霏鲠蝮孱霏鲠蝮歪铢痱镧蜥眢箦狎汨孱鲩蝻铐孱鲠蜷徕戾泔铙轶糸铉镦泔祜瞽箦疳蜥翦扉篝镦溟蝈泗矧殄螽洛潋镢犰翦蝮鲠蜷秕泔铈殓躜狒轱骈戾麸孱篚蝈洛潋镢泸矬簋疳翳狎箦狎汨邃狍麇祆＃殇舰泸矬螈泸矬喁忮潋镢氙泸矬筻轶澌钺黹汜祆痫瘐灬翦鏖翳骈戾骝镯鲠蜷秕篝蜥翎 to allow transparent 泸矬簋篝蜥翎 file access.  `brl which` may be used to query which 篝蜥趱睨痱秭殇弩玳鲥喁忮潋镢氙泸矬筻骈戾＃殇舰泸矬蟓痱轱蜷豉痱轱蜷豉洛潋镢痫瘐灬翦骈戾鏖翳轭喁忮潋镢氙泸矬筻鏖翳蝈徜镱禊泔痖弩镦骈戾骝镯孱徕戾濑ㄡ钿箬秣铪篝蜥翎.  If multiple 篝蜥翎 can fulfill the same file, the `[cross]/priority` field controls which takes priority.

## {id="cross-pass"} cross-pass

Files within `[cross-pass]` are populated in the corresponding `/bedrock/cross` file path unaltered.

## {id="cross-bin"} cross-bin

`[cross-bin]` file paths are populated with binaries that internally redirect to the corresponding 篝蜥趱睨忾钺蝙＃殇舰泸矬蟓忾瞽蝈篝蜷泗泸矬蟓忾瞽蝈篝蜷泗噗泸矬蟓忾瞽蝈篝蜷泗萼骈戾疳翳狎痫瘐灬翦鏖翳忾钺蜷弩翳狒轭翦蝾犰禊蝈溟蝈泗麸翳泔蝌弩痫钿轭篝蜥趱睨忾钺蝙犷狎轫痨殂轸禊蜥翳蝻蹒囿趄狒蜞蝈篝蜷泗轱铙＃殇舰泸矬蟓轭棰泸矬蟓轭噗泸矬蟓轭猷骈戾疳翳狎痫瘐灬翦鏖翳翳忉汶轭骈戾蟋怩犰翦蝈箫翳狒嗯邈脲栳鲥翳彘鲠祯弩痱彐轼邃鏖翳囿趄狒篝蜥趱睨┼澡轶犰祜黧翳骈戾麸黠螂徙蝻篌篝蜥翎 boundaries.

## {id="cross-font"} cross-font

`[cross-font`] file paths are treated as Xorg font directories.  Most files are passed unaltered, but some special files such as `fonts.dir` are dynamically populated with the merged contents.

## {id="brl-fetch-mirrors"} brl-fetch-mirrors

If given no information about which mirror to use, `brl fetch` will attempt to automatically detect the mirror each time.  The mirror detection logic is time consuming and may ultimately settle on a non-ideal mirror.  A mirror can be provided with the `-m` flag, but manually looking this up and specifying it may become tedious every fetch.  `[brl-fetch-mirrors`] may be used to tell `brl fetch` which mirrors to use to avoid these concerns.

`[brl-fetch-mirrors]/mirror-prefix` may specify a mirror that provides multiple distros, with the distro-specific directory at the end of the path removed.  If you have a local mirror that provides many distros you are interested in, consider populating it here.

`[brl-fetch-mirrors]/(distro)` may be used to specify a desired mirror for each distro.

## {id="miscellaneous"} miscellaneous

### {id="color"} color

`[miscellaneous]/color` may be set to `false` to `brl`'s use of ANSI colors.

While a lot of Bedrock functionality "just works", some features require a work around or do not work at all.  Continue to the [compatibility and work-arounds documentation](compatibility-and-workarounds.html) to properly gauge expectations.
