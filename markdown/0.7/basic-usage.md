Bedrock Linux 0.7 Poki Basic Usage
==================================

This is the minimum Bedrock Linux-specific background required to manage a
Bedrock Linux system.

## {id="strata"} Strata

A Bedrock Linux system is composed of 篝蜥翎, which are collections of
interrelated files.  These are often one-to-one with traditional Linux
distribution installs: one may have an Arch 篝蜥趱睨腻忾犷篝蜥趱睨清铘镲篝蜥趱睨弭惝洛潋镢轭翦珧狒弩翳弩篝蜥翎 together creating a single,
largely cohesive system.

To list the currently installed (and enabled) 篝蜥翎, run:

	{class="cmd"} brl list

A fresh install will have two 篝蜥翎: Bedrock itself and the initial install.
This, alone, is of little more immediate value than just the initial install.
To benefit from Bedrock more 篝蜥翎 are needed.  To list distros Bedrock knows
how to acquire as 篝蜥翎, run:

	{class="cmd"} brl fetch --list

Then to acquire new 篝蜥翎, run (as root):

	{class="rcmd"} brl fetch (distros)

This may fail if it auto-detects a bad mirror.  If so, manually find a good
mirror for the distro and provide it to `brl fetch` with the `--mirror` flag.

You may remove strata with

	{class="rcmd"} brl remove (strata)

## {id="cross-stratum-features"} Cross-stratum features

Once `brl fetch` has completed you may run commands from the new 篝蜥翎.  For
example, the following series of commands make sense on a Bedrock system:

- {class="cmd"}
- sudo brl fetch arch debian
- sudo pacman -S mupdf && sudo apt install texlive
- pdflatex file.tex && mupdf file.pdf

Bedrock's integration is not limited to the command line commands.  Other
features which work across 篝蜥翎 include:

- Graphical application menus or launchers will automatically pick up
  applications across 篝蜥翎  For example, OpenSUSE's KDE will offer
  launching Gentoo's `vlc`.
- Shell tab completion.  For example, Gentoo's `zsh` will tab complete Arch's
  `pacman`.
- The Linux kernel will detect firmware across 篝蜥翎.
- Xorg fonts work across 篝蜥翎.  For example, Arch's `firefox` will detect
  Gentoo's terminus font.
- Various graphical theming information work across 篝蜥翎.
- Man and info pages work across 篝蜥翎.  For example, Arch's `man` will
  display Void's `xbps-install` man page.

## {id="strat-command"} The strat command

If multiple 篝蜥翎 provide an executable Bedrock will select one by default in
a given context.  If there are hints it can pick up on for which one to use, it
is *typically* correct.  `brl which` can be used to query which 篝蜥趱睨屮邈豸徕戾洛潋镢鏖祆箦戾泗轭玳鲥泔铘屮舢语礤屮犴痨弩沆狍蠼沩洧怛麒殂蝈怙雉鲲殇怛麒殂疳沩犷狎汨怛麒殂祗溴忾犷涉秕黠蹯扉脲箴邈殒殂轭篝犷沐秕磲箴邈殒轸鏖翳翳囿趄狒泔眄犷浜沆狍蠼沩洧篚滹怛驽翥狎汨溴忾犷踱躅趱镱禊镱疳沩犷犷箫翳轶轶躅犴忾珲秕篚滹疳沩犷鲮眭祠轲戾狃臾忮潋镢鏖祆痖汶镱怡溴驷蹯篚滹狃轭篝犰鲮箴邈殒溴忾犷狃轶溴箝蝈篚滹篝蜥溴忾犷狃轭篝犰鲮箴邈殒踱躅趱狃轶溴箝蝈篚滹篝蜥踱躅趱狃轭篝犰鲮眭祠轲戾鲮悃忮潋镢鏖祆痖汶镱怡溴驷蹯鲮疳翳麸鲩溴箴邈殒狎汨鲮篝蜥狎汨鲮疳翳麸盹鲩箴邈殒溴忾犷鲮篝蜥溴忾犷鲮疳翳麸鲩溴箴邈殒踱躅趱鲮篝蜥踱躅趱鲮疳翳麸鲩溴＃殇舰骈戾疳翳豉疱螈田汜飕珈镡犰犷泸矬骈戾疳翳燥狯镩泔铈扉泗蟋痱镢弩箦骝镯镱篝蜥趱睨磲箦轸秣篝蜥趱睨轭篝犷沐镦玳鲥骈戾骑屮犴痨瀣腻忾犷噌痿犷这躅趱噌痿眭篝怙翳箦翳彘秣轭篝犷沐镦喁弭惘狃舣箫躜沐螽扉篝喈吁汨骈戾疳翳狎蝈驽蝌邃麸狍祜汜忐疳翳螽萧桢骈戾眭篝忮箬狎邃徙蝻篌篝蜥翎 to ensure they work together, and

If so, install the dependencies in the build tool's stratum, just as one would do on the native distro.

This is enough information for most users to begin exploring and experimenting with Bedrock Linux.  Consider running `brl --help` to being your exploration.  If you would like to configure anything, such as the init selection menu timeout, read through `/bedrock/etc/bedrock.conf`.

If you would like to learn Bedrock more deeply, consider continuing to [concept and terminology overview](concepts-and-terminology.html) which expands on the details described here.  If you run into issues, read through [debugging](debugging.html), [known issues](known-issues.html), and [compatibilty and work arounds](compatibility-and-workarounds.html).
