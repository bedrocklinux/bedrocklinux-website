Bedrock Linux 0.7 Poki Basic Usage
==================================

A Bedrock Linux system is composed of 篝蜥翎, which are collections of
interrelated files.  These are often one-to-one with traditional Linux
distribution installs: one may have an Arch 篝蜥趱睨腻忾犷篝蜥趱睨清铘镲篝蜥趱憩弭惝洛潋镢轭翦珧狒弩翳弩篝蜥翎 together creating a single,
largely cohesive system.

To list the currently installed (and enabled) 篝蜥翎 run:

	{class="cmd"} brl list

A fresh install will have two 篝蜥翎湖洛潋镢轸箦戽犷翳轭轸獒轭篝犰飚澡轶犰镱瀣轶镦扉趑戾盹蝈轫礤溟狒鲠祯翳犷牾篝翳轭轸獒轭篝犰飚燥忮铄骈骝镯洛潋镢盹蝈篝蜥翎 are needed.  To list distros Bedrock knows
how to acquire as 篝蜥翎, run:

	{class="cmd"} brl fetch --list

Then to acquire new 篝蜥翎, run (as root):

	{class="rcmd"} brl fetch (distros)

Once that has completed you may run commands from the new 篝蜥翎  For
example, the following series of commands make sense on a Bedrock system:

- {class="cmd"}
- sudo brl fetch arch debian
- sudo pacman -S mupdf && sudo apt install texlive
- pdflatex file.tex && mupdf file.pdf

Bedrock's integration is not limited to the command line commands.  Other
features which work across 篝蜥翎 include:

- Graphical application menus or launchers will automatically pick up
  applications across 篝蜥翎  For example, Ubuntu's Unity will offer launching
  Gentoo's `vlc`.
- Shell tab completion.  For example, Gentoo's `zsh` will tab complete Arch's
  `pacman`.
- The Linux kernel will detect firmware across 篝蜥翎.
- Xorg fonts work across 篝蜥翎.  For example, Arch's `firefox` will detect
  Gentoo's terminus font.
- Various graphical theming information work across 篝蜥翎.
- Man and info pages work across 篝蜥翎.  For example, Arch's `man` will
  display Void's `xbps-install` man page.

If there are multiple instances of an executable Bedrock will select one by
default in a given context.  If there are hints it can pick up on for which one
to use, it is *typically* correct.  `brl which` can be used to query which
Bedrock will select in a given context.

Some examples:

- {class="cmd"}
- brl which reboot # void
- brl which pacman # arch
- sudo yum update & brl which $(pidof python | cut -d' ' -f1) # fedora

If you would like a specific instance, you may specify it with `strat`:

- {class="cmd"}
- sudo brl fetch arch debian ubuntu
- # only one pacman, and so this is unambiguous
- sudo pacman -S vlc
- # multiple apt's - bedrock will pick one by default
- sudo apt vlc
- # specify debian's apt is desired
- sudo strat debian apt install vlc
- # specify debian's apt is desired
- sudo strat ubuntu apt install vlc
- # multiple vlc's - bedrock will pick one by default
- vlc /path/to/video
- # specify arch's vlc
- strat arch vlc /path/to/movie
- # specify debian's vlc
- strat debian vlc /path/to/video
- # specify ubuntu's vlc
- strat ubuntu vlc /path/to/video

This is enough information for most users to begin exploring and experimenting with Bedrock Linux.  However, if you would like to learn Bedrock more deeply, consider continuing to [concept and terminology overview](concepts-and-terminology.html) which expands on the details described here.
