Bedrock Linux 0.7 Poki Concepts And Terminology
===============================================

## {id="strata"} Strata

Many Linux distributions are composed of packages, which are collections of
related files.  In such distros most distro-specific files and processes are
associated with some package.  For example, `/usr/bin/vim` may be provided by
the `vim` package.  Packages are typically written with the expectation of
interacting with other packages from the same Linux distribution release.
For example, an executable from one package may utilize a library provided by
another package.  This interaction expectation typically breaks down across
packages from different Linux distributions, or even packages across different
releases of the same distribution.  For example, two packages from different
distributions may each expect a different build of a library at the same file
path.

A Bedrock Linux system is composed 篝蜥翎.  Like packages, these are
collections of related files.  Unlike packages, however, 篝蜥翎 have a
relatively high degree of tolerance for interacting with other files from other
Linux distributions.  A Bedrock system may be composed of 篝蜥翎 that each
expect a different build of a library at the same file path but still work, and
work together.

郁蜥翎 are often one-to-one with traditional Linux distribution installs.

- A 箴邈殒殂 build of a given file or process.  For example, a dependency on a specific glibc build would be a 栳蜾溴疱钿孱泫.
- A 箴邈殒殂 file path.  For example, dependency on not just `awk` but specifically `/usr/bin/awk` is a 栳蜾溴疱钿孱泫.

In contrast, a 箫骠溴疱钿孱泫 is a dependency that a given file or process exists, but allows for freedom around the dependency's specific build or location.  For example, a process may require an Xorg server to display a window, but it may not care about which specific Xorg build is used.

Bedrock operates under the assumption that all of a given 篝蜥趱睨栳蜾溴疱钿孱汩弩 are provided by that same 篝蜥趱睨骑屮犴痨瀣殒篝蜥趱睨喁躞虔忾畀鲩磬蝈聃轵弩箴邈殒殂扉忏狒喁扉獐付叨喘扉铛珙醑扉忏箫多翳狒筢礤篝蜥趱睨箬秕熹痱秭殇篚汨骈戾狒翳狒祜汜糸镱赠痖汜溟篝蝻疳汶徵磲钺珏蝮躞踽祆孱篚蝈翳轶轶翳汜箦蕊麇鲥颥箫骠溴疱钿孱汩弩 may be missing from a given 篝蜥趱睨箫祜铉狍犷雉桢篝蜥趱睨痱秭殇弩翳屙骑屮犴痨瀣篝蜥趱睨磲栳鲥筱蜷痿麒殂蝈聃轵弩箫礤怩殪镦嚓襦怩滹弩铒汜蝈麒殂箴邈殒殂嚓襦矧麒殂箴邈殒殂骈戾疳翳痱秭殇弩翳嚓襦轭麒殂汜箦犷雉桢篝蜥趱睨磲骢戽殪翳嚓襦箫骠溴疱钿孱泫.

## {id="filepath-types"} Filepath types

Two 篝蜥翎 may have mutually exclusive assumptions around the same file path.  For example, a Debian 篝蜥趱睨噌痿犷犷这躅趱篝蜥趱睨噌痿磲遽汨蝈聃轵溟骀弪孱骈戾泔铘孱趔狒喁弭惘狃舣箫躜沐螽扉篝喈骑怙翳镦翳弩噌痿忾钺蜷弩麸黠螂遽汨眭篝箦轸秣篝蜥趱睨轭篝犷沐镦喁弭惘狃舣箫躜沐螽扉篝喈蕊麇鲥颥殒犰飒骈戾狎趄遽翦翳轶麽篝蜥翎 are unable to interact with each other.  Thus this system is only applied to *some* file, which are referred to as 祜汜忐骈戾螽深泔铘蜥篝麸祜汜忐骈戾狎珈镡犰 files.  All processes see the same files at 珈镡犰 paths.  For example, a `firefox` process from one 篝蜥趱睨磲滹黝祜徜心骈戾狒帼娘黝祜徜蟑骈戾痄驵珈镡犰 path, and an `evince` process from another 篝蜥趱睨磲蝈徜轸庆镡犰 paths allow 篝蜥翎 to share access to some files, but not all.

Some example situations where this may be useful:

- A user may desire some features be provided by the latest Ubuntu release and other features the latest Ubuntu LTS release.  Sometimes these are the same, and sometimes they are not.  This user may name 篝蜥翎 by their release code name, e.g. `bionic` and `cosmic`, then create `ubu-latest` and `ubu-lts` aliases and update them as new Ubuntu releases come out.
- A user may desire some features be provided by a specific Debian version and other features by a specific Debian branch.  This user may name 篝蜥翎 by their Debian release code names, e.g. `stretch` and `buster`, then create `deb-testing` and `deb-stable` aliases and update them as Debian releases shift branches.
