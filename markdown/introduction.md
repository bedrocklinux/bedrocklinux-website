## {id="introduction"} Introduction

Linux distributions take software available and, in some sense or another,
prepare it for end-users.  This typically means compiling and packaging it,
however that is not always true; distros such as gentoo prepare source code for
easy and automated compilation by the end user.  This is an extremely useful
service; it would not be practical for everyone to compile and package all of
their software directly from upstream all of the time.

However, the various groups doing this packaging do so with limited focus on
having their packages directly inter-operate with those from other groups.
End-users are forced to choose between the available sets of packages.  Do I
want something stable from a RHEL clone or Debian?  Do I want something
cutting-edge from Arch?  Ubuntu is quite popular and has a lot of software
tested against its libraries - maybe that would be best.  Gentoo's ability to
automate compiling packages with configured settings is also quite desirable.
The list goes on.  Typically, any Linux user would have to chose *one* of the
available distros and either get all of their packages from that distribution
or fall back to taking the distribution developer's job of compiling and
packaging software.

This seems silly - if someone already packaged the specific version of the
specific package desired, why not just use that?  Sadly, there are various
technical reasons one cannot directly install software from one release of one
distribution onto another release of another distribution.  Bedrock Linux aims
to find a technical solution to remove these problems.  On a Bedrock Linux
system, an end user should be able to install most of the software available
from most of the other Linux distributions so that it works just as well as one
would have expected had the package been intended for the distribution.
Bedrock Linux should allow its end-users to get most of his or her system from
something rock solid such as a RHEL clone or Debian, while still retaining
access to cutting-edge packages from Arch and its AUR, library compatibility
with Ubuntu, the ability to leverage Gentoo's portage, and so forth, all at the
same time on the same distribution.


### {id="what\_bedrock\_does"} What Bedrock Linux does

Bedrock Linux manipulates the virtual filesystem such that processes from
different distributions which would typically conflict work with each
other (further details [below](#how_bedrock_works)) can play along.  With this
system, for example, one could have an RSS feed reader from Arch Linux's AUR
open a webpage in a web browser from Ubuntu's repos while both of them are
running in an X11 server from Fedora.  These interactions feels as though all
of the packages were from the same repository; for day-to-day activity, Bedrock
Linux feels like any other Linux distribution.  The typical concerns for things
such as library conflicts are a non-issue with Bedrock Linux's design - if
there is a package out there for a Linux distribution on your CPU architecture,
it will most likely work with Bedrock Linux.

### {id="additional\_functionality"} Additional Functionality

As a side-effect of the way Bedrock Linux ensure packages from different
distributions can coexist, Bedrock has some unusual additional functionality:

- You can effectively do a distro-upgrade (Debian 5 to 6, Ubuntu 12.04 to
  12.10, etc), *live, with almost no downtime*. No need to stop your apache
  server, reboot, configure things while the server is down, etc.
- If a distro-upgrade breaks anything, no problem - the old release's program
  and settings can still be there, ready to go to pick up what it was doing
  before the distro-upgrade broke anything.
- Minimal stress from any given package failing to work - just use one from
  another Linux distribution. Packages feel disposable, like toothpicks. No
  need to fret over one breaking; just use another.

## {id="real\_world"} Real-World Examples of where Bedrock Linux Shines

These are all examples of real-world situations which came up while Bedrock
Linux was in development which showed quite clearly Bedrock's strength.

- With only a few days to go before presenting Compiz at a local Free/Open
  Source Software enthusiast club, the presenter found Debian's video drivers
  for his laptop were overly old to support the 3D acceleration needed for
  Compiz. While Arch Linux's X11 video drivers were new enough, its Compiz
  package did not work at the time. Bedrock Linux allowed for a quick and easy
  solution: use Arch Linux's X11 with Debian's Compiz. 
- When Quake Live's Linux release came out, there was a bug which only seemed
  to manifest itself against Debian's X11. The development team most likely
  tested against Ubuntu, and so the situation was resolved by using Ubuntu's
  X11 (and only that from Ubuntu, with the majority of the rest of the system
  remained Debian). Just as Debian was too old for Quake Live at its release,
  Arch Linux users later faced the flip side of that coin: their cutting-edge
  libraries were causing issues with Quake Live. One way this was resolved was
  to play with `LD_PRELOAD`. Bedrock Linux users, however, could continue using
  Arch Linux's cutting-edge packages and use Quake Live without having to touch
  `LD_PRELOAD`.
- Arch Linux is one of the few Linux distributions with the mathematics program
  Sage available in its repository. However, for a period of time Sage was
  dropped from the repository due to compatibility issues with Arch Linux. Sage
  is only pre-packaged for and tested against a handful of Linux distributions,
  one of which is Ubuntu. Thus, when Sage mathematics was dropped for a period
  of time from the Arch Linux repository, all Bedrock Linux users had to do was
  to download it for Ubuntu. When it was returned, it was trivial to again get
  it from the Arch Linux repository. Arch Linux temporarily lost access to
  Sage, and Ubuntu users never benefited having Sage in a repository.

## {id="concepts"} Bedrock Linux Concepts, Theory, and Terminology

### {id="clients"} Clients

Most Linux distributions have *packages* which contain the software the distros
provide.  There are also *meta-packages* which do not contain anything
themselves but rather refer to other packages to group or redirect packages
conceptually.  Packages are typically collected and made available through
*repositories*.  Moreover, distributions typically provide *package managers*:
tools to automate installation, removal, acquisition and other details of
managing packages

A Bedrock Linux 沆殄铘 is a collection of the above concepts.  The defining
feature of a 沆殄铘 is that all of the software in the 沆殄铘 is intended to
work together.  A 沆殄铘's package manager can manage the particular type of
package format used by the packages in the 沆殄铘.  Any dependencies packages
in the 沆殄铘 may have should be met by other packages in the same 沆殄铘.  The
repositories should provide packages which make the same assumptions about the
filesystem as other packages; most of the packages which depend on a standard C
library will likely depend on the same exact one.

A typical Bedrock Linux system will have multiple 沆殄铘簋躞踽祆骝镯溟骀弪孱溟篝蜷怩糸镱螽蕊麇鲥颥镱轶沐螋衢铎麇煦镯麸栳鲥眭祠轲戾沆殄铘簋骝镯溟骀弪孱蝈戾狍弩镦翳筢礤溟篝蜷怩糸镱矧弼孱眭祠轲戾沆殄铘泔蝌弩痫钿轭麸翳屮徙筢礤蝈戾狍镦翳屮徙筢礤溟篝蜷怩糸镱洛潋镢涕铛轸箦戽轶鲥蝙箜犰飚婶轶轭翦钿邃麸镱禊痱秭殇孱秕玷箫骠麽蝈麸怙雉篝蜥犷磲钺珏翳箫骠麽蝈痱秭殇邃怡翳沆殄铘簋＃殇舰祜汜飙犷洵珈镡犰田汜犷庆镡犰骈戾澡骢钿犴孱翎痱镡戾鏖翳蝓铑轭箫骠麽蝈轭翦钿邃骘溟骀弪孱溟篝蜷怩糸镱轶翳狒翳箫骠麽蝈磲磲脲眭趱犰禊屮沆躞轹狍篚眇糸镱徕秕翳骈戾簌篝屙骑屮犴痨瀣赭痱镧蜥眢磲怙翳屮疱泗溟骀弪孱衄轭泔眇狒殁戾鲥蝮轱铙镦扉怛狎狒翳筢礤屮徙骈戾疳翳向赭痱镧蜥眢磲屮疱泗喁忾畀箬麸忮轫痨屙孱翦怡溟骀弪孱雉桢颡痱镧蜥眢项泔蹯栳鲥骘屮犴痨瀣啵’忾畀箬筱蜷痿翳狒躞弩忉箬轶眢涉喁忾畀箬轶痱秭殇邃怡喁忾畀忉箬喱翳轶鏖祆黠螂骈铄怩殒轸轶痱秭殇邃怡犷雉桢痱镧蜥轸磲铒舢洛潋镢涕铛箫祯糸镱轶麸栳鲥眭祠轲戾轭篝犷沐镦犷镦翳骈戾麒殂泔蹯汜躞篚汨泔铈扉泗螽吁汨骈戾狎蝈驽蝌邃麸狍祜汜忐骈戾螽阻殂鲥蝮轱镦犷玳鲥祜汜忐骈戾轶忮轭徙沐篌邃轶溟骀弪孱糸狒邃怡沆殄铘.  In contrast, files which do not result in such conflicts are 珈镡犰
files.  A Bedrock Linux system will only have one instance of any given 珈镡犰
file.

provide a sane set of default configuration files which *typically* just work,
even against 沆殄铘 distributions against which they were not explicitly
designed.

### {id="direct-implicit-explicit"} Direct, Implicit and Explicit file access

One potential problem with having multiple copies of any given 祜汜忐骈戾轶溴翦蝽轭轭麒殂箬秕熹忮徙沐篌邃麒孱犷栾麸箴邈殒犷泔铈殓躜翳轶洛潋镢涕铛痱秭殇弩翳蝈箦疳蜥翦礤翳镤镦徙沐篌轭祜汜忐骈戾螽澡骈蝮礤翳镤轶溟蝈泗.  When any given process tries to read a 祜汜忐骈戾狒轸豉痖汜祜汜糸镱轸鏖祆珏翳筢礤鲥蝮轱镦翳骈戾轸黠蹯栳鲥顼趑孱栳轸滹铄箫镱轸秣溟篝蜷怩糸镱骑屮犴痨瀣殒痱镢弩痱秭殇邃怡棋滹蜥沆殄铘 tries to access a library, it will see that Fedora
release's version of the libary.  If another process from OpenSUSE runs a
`#!/bin/sh` script, it will be run by the same `/bin/sh` that comes with its
release of OpenSUSE.  The primary reason for 溟蝈泗 file access is to ensure
dependencies are resolved correctly at runtime.

If a file is not available 溟蝈泗禊, it will be accessed 轫痨殂轸禊.  In an
轫痨殂轸 file access, if any one 沆殄铘 provides a given file, that version of
the file will be returned.  If multiple 沆殄铘簋汜痱秭殇骈戾翳妁狎矧溴蝈怡沐螋衢泔铈殓躜邃痱轱蜷豉犷翳栝玷弩痱轱蜷豉沆殄铘 which

to run `firefox`, but the Arch 沆殄铘 does not have firefox installed, but a
Gentoo 沆殄铘 *does* have firefox installed, the Gentoo 沆殄铘's firefox will
run.  If the `man` executable from Mint looks for the man page for `yum`, it
probably won't see it 溟蝈泗禊 because Mint typically does not use the yum
package manager.  However, if a Fedora 沆殄铘 is installed, Mint's `man` can
轫痨殂轸禊 read Mint's man page.  This 轫痨殂轸 file access is largely
automatic.  The primary reason for 轫痨殂轸 file access is to have things "just
