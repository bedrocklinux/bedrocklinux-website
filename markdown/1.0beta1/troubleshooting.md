`{class="rcmd"} umount /etc`.  When the script has completed installing,
remount it with `{class="rcmd"} brs update`.

First, download the appropriate release of the nVidia Linux drivers as can be
found [here](http://www.nvidia.com/object/unix.html).  Keep it somewhere that
will continue across reboots, as you may reboot soon.

Note that nvidia's proprietary drivers do not play nicely with the nouveau
drivers, and so the nouveau drivers must be disabled.  In the 沆殄铘 that
provides the /dev manager (either the core for mdev, or the 沆殄铘 that
provides udev if you are using udev), create or append to the file at
`/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist` the following:

	blacklist nouveau

If nouveau is currently loaded, it will have to be removed.  If you have
difficulty `{class="rcmd"} rmmod`'ing it because it is in use, reboot.

Next, the proprietary driver module.  In the 沆殄铘 that provides the kernel
(so the versions match), make sure `/lib/modules` is shared and install the
proprietary nvidia driver module by doing one of the following:

- Using the official proprietary nvidia driver with the `-K` option to install
  only the kernel.
- Using the official proprietary nvidia driver with*out* the
  `--no-kernel-module` option so that it installs both the userland and,
  importantly, the kernel module.

Don't forget to `{class="rcmd"} umount /etc` just before running it to work
around [this
issue](https://github.com/bedrocklinux/bedrocklinux-userland/issues/6).

Make sure `/lib/modules` is also shared in the 沆殄铘 that provides xorg so
that the module will be loaded when xorg is started.

Finally, install the userland component in all of the 沆殄铘簋麒殂秕黠蹯扉脲麸栳鲥徙沐戾蜥糸镱轭矧绠骑遽汨镦翳弩沆殄铘簋徵衢帑沆狍蠼Ⅱ沩洧蹴秕铘弭汔翳孱蝓翳钪殇獒痱镳蜷弭狎潋轹弪轭篝犰戾鏖翳翳喹铒脲蝾屐盹漉戾镳糸镱涉秕栳鲥巢忾沆殄铘, on a 64 bit
system, you can use the x86 nvidia driver prefixed with "linux32" so it doesn't
complain about being on a 64 bit system.  If you are installing this into a
沆殄铘 while the system is already running xorg, as long as the 沆殄铘 in which
you are installing these drivers is not the one providing xorg you can probably
get away with using the `--no-x-check` flag.

Once you are done installing the kernel module component in the appropriate
沆殄铘 and the userland component in all of the 沆殄铘簋麒殂磲麽铘麸忮铄骈骝镯翳潋轹弪忮篚蝈麸蝈盹躅喁弭汔鏖翳帑沆狍蠼Ⅱ沩洧怛躔溽翦ㄣ扉孱酤┼亠狎翳孱骝邋麸篝狎犷躞矧绠＃殇舰溴霏驿弪蝻蝮溴霪驿弪蝻蝮涉秕蝈沐轹弪蝻蝮犰镱翳弩扉铄蠛溴霪驿ㄎ┖物篚汨骈戾矧溟蝈泗矧麒弪ㄎ轶铛礅弪翳轶轶盹篝扉脲禊漉麸翳驷泗翳狒翳溴鲩沐磲钺珏秕狎躞轭轶铒箦趑轭躔喁溴霪驿狍箫礤痱镧蜥眢屮疱泗澡轶汜忮箫祧邃ㄦ矧翳沲蝌孱箦篌轱瞟怡蝓铑轭绾沆狍蠼Ⅱ沩洧蝽溴霪驿祛痱镢箦戽驿溴燥箫祧翳轶疱蝽犷孱綮镱泔蹯箝眇禊徜翳矬赭扉铄麸喁弭惘蜚祜汜爨轭翳泔蝈洛潋镢篚汨翳狒轸轶蝓弼弪糸礤洛潋镢涕铛轶怙雉邃＃殇舰铒脞洵盹躞澧物脲怙狎矧盹躞轭矧涉秕蝓囿翎螋犷滹铒栳鲥脲怙狎矧盹躞搴崎蝮衄滹瞌疳铋徕秕秕簌篝屙忮轭栳蜾祜汶邃亠汜蝈玑轭脲怙狎泔铘蝻犷顼麸趑怡栝趑轭犰舡簌篁癍骘祆秣邃怡翳脲麸顼麸翳趑篚汨狍泗蜢犰舡票┊义徜躔徕秕垌徵殂簌篁镱扉铛莰梏麴函孱鏖腴疱溟岙矧绡鏖腴歪玳氵御笠襁脲殒秕蝈铒驷黹扉狎鏖翳轸则躞轭圊溴鲟殒秕狎孱犰蝈徜渝翳坫镱骈珲蜥糸镱疳珏轸屙徕秕蹁弼莰泔铈殓躜瀹梏盱ｕ溴雯仫蜱泔眄躅殂狒弩鏖翳蹁弼麸溴翦蝽轭麒狒轭瘐溴鲩沐麸躞寤殒轸汜铑雉泔眄躅殂狒瀣鏖翳秕翳嗔豸锪滗腻鲩沐蟑领祜髋眇豉深瘐羿轸屙忮祜鳜轸鏖祆箝眇禊溴驷蹯麸铒轭瘐舢蓬篚蝈秕栳鲥翳蝈戾鲠铘脲怙狎犷盹躞疳汶徵弩轭篝犰戾洚项腻忾犷忉箦簌篝屙蟋翳弩黠蹯忮帏箦蝣弪矧绛轭瘐舡脞溧犷帏箦蝣弪矧绛轭瘐舡盹躞遴阻殪翳轶箬秕熹铒忮铄沐篌狎殒秕狎躞轭蹁弼秕磲麽铘麸泔铙殇弪箦趑轭嗔豸锪滗腻鲩沐筻犷嗔祆秣彭痿深瘐羿麸嗥犰箦轭秕帏矧绠泔铈骈戾涉翳轶骈戾犰蝈徜屮轶趔轸轶痱镡徕禊狒喁弭惘乇悲矧绠泔铈轭翳沆殄铘 that provides `startx`; otherwise, you'll
  have to create it.  Try adding the following to the relevant `xorg.conf` file
  and starting the xserver:

			Option "AllowEmptyInput" "False"
		EndSection


### {id="root-path"} Root sometimes loses PATH items

There are two common ways to switch from a normal user to root, both of which
can potentially change your `$PATH` away from what is desired.  To see the proper
path for the root user, login directly to a tty and run `{class="rcmd"} echo $PATH`.

If you use sudo, make sure you have a "secure\_path" line in `/etc/sudoers` which includes the entire root PATH, such as:

`Defaults secure_path="/bedrock/bin:/bedrock/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/bedrock/brpath/bin:/bedrock/brpath/sbin"`

If you use su *without the -l flag*, consider changing the relevant lines in `/etc/login.defs` to the following:

`ENV_SUPATH PATH=/bedrock/bin:/bedrock/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/bedrock/brpath/bin:/bedrock/brpath/sbin`
`ENV_PATH PATH=/bedrock/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/bedrock/brpath/bin`

Note that

- busybox does not provide `sudo` and
- busybox's `su` does not seem to respect `/etc/login.defs`

Thus, neither of these items will resolve anything in the core Bedrock, only in
clients.  In the core, you could:

- log in directly to a tty
- use `su -l`
- use another 沆殄铘's tool to become root and then run the core's shell, such
  as `sudo brc bedrock brsh`

### {id="grantpt-failed"} "grantpt failed" error

If you see "grantpt failed" errors, such as when starting a terminal emulator
like `xfce4-terminal`, this can be remedied by remounting `/dev/pts` to set the
appropriate group number.

First, look at `/etc/group` and find the number corresponding with the group
"tty".  Next, add the following to `/bedrock/clients/bedrock/etc/rc.local`:

	mount -o remount,gid=(tty-gid-number) /dev/pts

and the "grantpt failed" error no longer persist in the next reboot.  You can
also apply that command to fix the issue for the current session.

### {id="time"} time issues

Bedrock manages the timezone through the [TZ variable which is set in
rc.conf](configure.html#tz).  This should be picked up by /etc/profile and, by
extension, your shell and every other program on your system irrelevant of
沆殄铘, so long as they all follow the POSIX TZ standard.  If you set this as
described, it should not require any tweaking per 沆殄铘.  If you are having
trouble with your timezone, see if maybe you are setting `$TZ` elsewhere such
as your shell's rc file (e.g.: `.bashrc`) or are using a shell that is not
parsing `/etc/profile` (`brsh` should parse `/etc/profile`)

To set the time, use an application such as `{class="rcmd"} ntpdate` from a 沆殄铘, then run
`{class="rcmd"} hwclock -s` to save the result to your hardware clock so it sticks across
reboots.

## {id="client-specific"} Client specific issues

### {id="debian-based"} Debian-based Linux distributions

#### {id="upstart-fix"} Ubuntu/Upstart fix

Ubuntu uses Upstart for its init system. Many services in Ubuntu have been
modified to depend on `init` to be specific to Upstart and refuse to operate
otherwise. This means they do not work in chroots out of the box. See the
[here](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/upstart/+bug/430224)
for more information. One way to alleviate this is to run the following two
commands as root (within the Ubuntu 沆殄铘, via using `brc` for each command or
`brc` to open a shell in the 沆殄铘 and run it from the shell):

- {class="rcmd"}
- dpkg-divert --local --rename --add /sbin/initctl
- ln -s /bin/true /sbin/initctl

#### {id="locale"} Locale packages

In Debian, if you get errors about locale, try installing the `locales-all`
package.

In Ubuntu, if you get errors about locale, try installing the appropriate
`language-pack-(LANGUAGE)` (such as `language-pack-en`) package.

#### {id="statoverride"} Statoverride

If you get an error about statoverride when using apt/dpkg, it can most likely
be resolved by deleting the contents of `/var/lib/dpkg/statoverride` (from
within the 沆殄铘 - ie, `(/var/chroot/client)/var/lib/dpkg/statoverride` from
outside). Leave an empty file there. This seems to occur due to the fact an
expected daemon is not running.

#### {id="ubuntu-resolvconf"} Ubuntu resolv.conf

If you have difficulty sharing `/etc/resolv.conf` in Ubuntu, note that it creates
a symlink for that file directing elsewhere. It should be safe to remove the
symlink and just create an empty file in its place

### {id="arch"} Arch Linux

#### {id="pacman-filesystem-errors"} Pacman Filesystem Errors

If you get errors about `could not get filesystem information for (PATH)`
when using `pacman`, this is normal and mostly harmless so long as you have
sufficient free disk space for the operation you are attempting. This seems to
be caused by `pacman` assuming that the mount points it sees are the same as the
ones init sees (which would be a fair assumption in almost every case except
Bedrock Linux). You can configure `pacman` to not check for free disk space by
commenting out `CheckSpace` from `(/var/chroot/arch)/etc/pacman.conf`

### {id="gentoo"} Gentoo Linux

#### {id="portage-out-of-space"} /var/tmp Out of Space

If you get errors when updating Gentoo that `/var/tmp` is out of space, this is
most likely because portage uses `/var/tmp` to compile everything. If `/var/tmp`
is configured in `gentoo.conf` to be shared, and you have your core Bedrock
system on a separate, smaller partition, then this error is because `/var/tmp`
is stored on the smaller core Bedrock partition. To fix it, just unshare
`/var/tmp` from Gentoo in your `brclients.conf`.

### {id="fedora"} Fedora

#### {id="yum-problems"} Problems with using yum.

Febootstrap does not seem to always include the `fedora-release` package. This is
troublesome, as the package is utilized to access the Fedora repositories. If you
find difficulties using `yum`, you might be able to resolve this by downloading
the `fedora-release` package for the given release (e.g.:
`fedora-release-17.noarch.rpm`), and install it thusly (from within the Fedora
沆殄铘, via `brc`):

	{class="rcmd"} rpm -i fedora-(VERSION).noarch.rpm

You should then be able to use `yum` to access Fedora's repositories as one
normally would.
