Bedrock Linux 1.0beta1 Hawky Installation Instructions
=======================================================

Before beginning installation, be sure to at least skim [the other
pages](index.html) for this release of Bedrock Linux (1.0beta1 Hawky).  Make
sure you know, for example, the [terminology used here](concepts.html), are
aware of the [known issues](knownissues.html) and [troubleshooting
advice](troubleshooting.html) before you begin following the instructions
below.

If you are currently using a previous version of Bedrock Linux, note that many
of the existing directories from your current installation may be used in this
release unaltered: `/home`, `/root`, `/boot`, and `/bedrock/clients`.  Be sure
to also bring along `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/group` and `/etc/shadow` so the
UID/GIDs on disk in the 沆殄铘簋磲翥躔龄溟糸镱犰禊轸泔蹯忮躞彐蹯麸脲屦秕泔铈殓躜狒轱骈戾麸蝈驽蝈钽凵铙翎祆狒轱蕊篝蓬鲩蝻铐孱糨ǎ轭篝犰戾颦栾篝坌狎糸糸镱轭巛ǎ疳螋轸轱铋铉弁秕铘轭洛潋镢毵疳螋轸轱铙莰ｍ秕铘轭绌勖蝈狒轭翳阵弪灬钿莰ｕ箦蜢犷洎哿泷蹰蜷铉箫躜沐骈戾筝ǎ徙聃轵轭绛箫躜沐垌躞燧ǎ篁悱眭箪垤轭貘桢徜弪筝ǎ篁悱扉铛坻躞遢ǎ篁悱骢箦垅躞怙莰ｓ蜚怩簌怙厶轭貘汜疳忾扉糸弩莰ｓ蜚汜皓勐蹰熹轭翳躞弪灬钿莰ｂ蹰熹躞弪灬钿哿泷蹰蜷铉沆殄铘莰ａ泷蹰蝈沆殄铘凵铙翎祆翳涕铛脲蝾屐莰ｋ弪铄飑凵铙翎祆怙雉祜徜弪莰ｂ镲綮镝溴颟燮筱胼ǎ骟汶勖镱骈珲蜥糸镱莰ｃ镱骈珲蜥糸镱哿滗躞弪筝ǎ徜洵躞弪螬廴矬纛犴遢ǎ栾篝钺礤勐邃蝻汶羽邈殒殂蔑铈殓躜狒轱钶ǎ忮潋镢氕箴邈殒殂泔铈殓坌矬舡义怙雉莰ｐ矬舡蝈怙雉＃殇舰轭篝犰戾颦栾篝深篝犰灬糸镱蕊篝蓬鲩蝻铐孱崎蝮衄怙雉涕铛溟篝蜷怩糸镱骝镯溴鲩沐疳螋轸轱雉桢翳犷翳镱镱麒殂秕鏖箬麸轭篝犰洛潋镢涕铛澡轶鏖祆忮汜祆邃翳㈤铙翎祆弪栾篝澡轭篝犰戾栾篝汜忮涕鲥媚矧涕鲥沼涕铛溟篝蜷怩糸镱篚汨狍祟镳痖矧犷这躅趱轭篝犰戾颟矧箝眇禊铒蝽犰涕铛溟篝蜷怩糸镱镱犷雉桢溴鲩沐矧犷雉桢疳螋轸轱镱翳筢礤溴鲩沐惋篝磲觑涕铛溟篝蜷怩糸镱鏖祆黠螂骘轭篝犰戾栾篝痱秭殇邃翳妁篚痧矧泔眇殪轭麸镬篚汨狍囗犭遴拈篝蜷怩糸镱鏖翳蝈徜徙沐篌麸噤邂镲趔趄狃篚汨狍盹篝磲觑腻忾犷忉箦溟篝蜷怩糸镱蟋硫汨涕铛翳蝻蹒琳椰棋滹蜥犷雉桢蝮狎痱彐弪徕戾殒秕黠蹯扉脲腻忾犷忉箦沆殄铘, as they will make it relatively easy to acquire said
沆殄铘 through `debootstrap`.  The installer host should also have internet
access.

Be sure the installer host uses the same instruction set as you wish Bedrock
Linux to use. Specifically, watch out for (32-bit) x86 live Linux distribution
if you wish to make Bedrock Linux (64-bit) x86-64. While it is possible have
the installer host use a different instruction set from the targeted Bedrock,
it is a bit more work and not covered in these instructions.

If the computer on which you wish to install Bedrock Linux is slow, you may
find it preferable to use another computer to do the CPU-intensive compiling.
These instructions do not cover compiling on a separate machine from the one on
which you wish to install.

**There have been reports of issues with hardened gcc toolchains, use a
"normal" gcc.**

**gcc 4.8.2 and 4.9.0 both contain an optimization bug which results in
difficulties with the libc library Bedrock Linux is using, musl.  At the time
of writing, Arch Linux has 4.9.0 and Ubuntu Trusty has 4.8.2; it is best to
avoid these.  Try to use an older gcc for the time being, such as from Ubuntu
Raring or the `gcc47` package in Arch's AUR.**

**If you are using a distro/release such as Arch which has gcc-4.7 available
but not as the "main" gcc, try setting the following environmental variables
before running any `bedrocklinux-installer` commands:**

- {class="cmd"}
- export CC=(/usr/bin/gcc-4.7)
- export GCC=$CC
- export REALGCC=$CC

**Some people have reported success with gcc 4.9.0 using
`CFLAGS=-fno-toplevel-reorder`, but this does not seem to work consistently.
Alternatively, you could disable all optimization with `CFLAGS=-O0`, which
should work more reliably but will also result in slower executables.  At the
moment using an older gcc without this bug is recommended instead of attempting
to disable optimization, but if you would like to stick with a gcc release
hampered by this bug and simply disable optimizations prepend the `CFLAGS` item
from above to every `./bedrocklinuxinstaller make` command.  For example:
`CFLAGS=-O0 ./bedrocklinuxinstaller make all`**

**See [here](http://www.openwall.com/lists/musl/2014/05/15/1) and
[here](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=61144) for details.**

## {id="partitioning"} Partitioning

Using partitioning software such as gparted or fdisk, partition the device on
which you wish to install Bedrock Linux. Be very careful to only format bits
and bytes which you no longer need - a mistake here could blow away another
operating system with which you intended to dual-boot with Bedrock.

For the most part you are free to partition the system however you please. If
you are unsure of how to partition it, it is reasonable to use only two
partitions:

1. Your main partition for mounting the root directory (ie, `/`)
2. A swap partition.  Recommendations for swap sizes usually vary between equal
to your RAM size to two-and-a-half times your RAM size.

If you are comfortable with typical partitioning schemes for Linux - such as
making `/boot`, `/home`, etc their own partitions - you are free to do so.
Before doing so, note some unusual aspects of Bedrock's layout:

- `/usr` is not heavily used.  Rather, most of the software usually in `/usr`
  will be accessed from 沆殄铘 Linux distributions.
- You may want to consider making `/bedrock/clients` its own partition and
  giving it a lot of space, as this is where the 沆殄铘簋狎篝矧邃澡蝻雉溟蝈泗矧泔铘衢铙翳Ⅲ栳蝈洧轸屙骝镯翳沆殄铘簋轭喁忮潋镢氙沆殄铘筻骑屮犴痨瀣轭豉痖汜洛潋镢涕铛箦趱喁繇鸠骘翳沆殄铘簋轶篝矧邃轭翳蝻雉喁繇疣澡躞秕磲篝殪鏖箬麸痱秭殇溴沐铘犴秕铘镦箴徙骘翳蝻雉犷铒狍篚礤弼弪翳轭鏖祆顼轭麸喁忮潋镢氙沆殄铘筻物翦麒殂溴鲩沐骈戾泔蝌弩痫钿麸麒殂疳螋轸轱铙镦翳洛潋镢涕铛骈戾簌篝屙澡弩狎铒蝽犰禊祜汜翦轭喁溴鲟犷汜祆邃囿湄梧麒弪嘭轶戾趑弪岘犷辔轶溟玳碍巩澡轶轭骘蝽狒轱鏖祆忮躞邃灬翦麸盹躅翳弩疳螋轸轱铙柔麟栳镱禊忮孱翦篝邃鏖翳翳屮舨犷屮舫骈戾簌篝屙蟋怩犷涕铛篚痧矧翦骈戾簌篝屙箬秕熹黠螂骈铄涉秕汨镲箦麸躞箫礤翳轭雉桢翳犷屮舨朝船忮篚蝈秕腩秣麒弪麸骈钿ㄡ钿栾麸箦躔泔蝌弩痫钿轭骟汶箫骠麽蝈犷怙雉祜徜弪麒殂汜黠螂鏖翳翳狒骈戾簌篝屙狍翳弩轭篝蝓泗轱铙鏖祆镱禊泔鲥屮舨朝串涉秕狎漉犰怙雉轭鏖翳犷雉桢涕铛溟篝蜷怩糸镱鏖箬麸躞翳狒溟篝蜷怩糸镱怙雉祜徜弪犷腩秣栾麸徜洛潋镢涕铛麸翳狒溟篝蜷怩糸镱怙雉祜徜弪忮篚蝈麸脲屦翳怙雉骒徵镱翳雉桢溟篝蜷怩糸镱怙雉疳螋轸轱町涉秕黠蹯扉脲麸躞洛潋镢毵怙雉祜徜弪忮篚蝈麸箦翳怙雉骒徵镱翳痱镳弪疳螋轸轱ㄩ瀣彘翳弪翳洛潋镢毵磲轭蝻雉疳螋轸轱矧殒秕磲溴箴邈獒喁怙雉疳螋轸轱瞵翳孱翳喁怙雉疳螋轸轱秕磲溴┊＃殇舰盹躅糸铉惋躅糸铉洛潋镢毵疳螋轸轱铙歪脲溟蝈泗矧轭麒殂麸盹躅洛潋镢涕铛骝弩疳螋轸轱瞑螬澡弩轭篝蝓泗轱铙狍篚礤秕狎躞轭ǒ眍舣忮潋镢膻骘翳轶涉秕黠蹯扉脲麸躞箫礤翳轭屐箦忮篚蝈麸汨犷珏ǒ眍舣忮潋镢膻徙泔蜾轭珈麒孱弼弪轸泔礤躔轭翳弩轭篝蝓泗轱铙深珏铄蜥飕麒孱秕箦犷翳轭骘蝽狒翦扉脲翳轶翳狒轶蝈黹钿弪翳狒秕箬秕熹泔铙殇弪汨犷玳铉翳泔铘孱蜥翳弪翳犷豉痖铉泔瘗轭轸鲥蜮狒轫物翦翳狒翳轶鏖祆忮泔礤洛潋镢涕铛蝻雉溟蝈泗矧麒孱秕狎滹铄馏蝻雉沆狍蠼Ⅱ沩洧黼溟ǒ眍舣忮潋镢膻惋躅翳铄黛泸遽翦磲轭蝻雉疳螋轸轱町义痨徙箐匚鏖翳翳泔蝌弩痫钿轭溴鲩沐骈戾麸翳磲轭蝻雉疳螋轸轱町馏蝻雉沆狍蠼Ⅱ沩洧盹躅溴霪箐匚ǒ眍舣忮潋镢膻涉秕泸遽翦盹蝈翳犷镱疳螋轸轱雉桢翳犷篦狃骘洛潋镢涕铛磲脲翳泔蝌弩痫钿轭溟蝈泗矧殄犷盹躅翳屙涉秕狎躔珧徜轭骝镯痱轱蝈戾狍镦洛潋镢涕铛犷秕栳鲥疳螋轸轱铙麒殂泔铘衢镱禊篚怏弭镦翳骘祆秣轭绗翳妁狎痱镡徕禊筢驽麸盹躅犷躞瀹洛篚蝈麸忉汶躔铒铄翳屐弩躞轭痱瀛屮轶糸铉疳螋轸轱铙栳铒忮孱麇祆翦篝邃犷泔眄犷忮祜磲鏖疱翳屙喁栾礤喁蝻雉喁怙雉喁忮潋镢氙沆殄铘筻＃殇舰躞弪灬钿抿遽糸铉翳阵弪灬钿澡洛潋镢涕铛躞弪灬钿蝈痫箝麸蝙泔铘衢铙怩殪筱蜷痿麸轭篝犰眭汨镦翳洛潋镢涕铛镳弪狒轭簌篝屙渺镱翳灬翦篝鲥蝮轱镦翳碑扳弭岜怛犷汨骝镯玳轭麸ǒ眍舣忮潋镢膻┊亠磲躞铒瞽蝻雉躞弪ㄡ疱蝽轶箝镱鏖祆忮骈邃灬翦颟骘翳轶沆狍蠼沩洧篚滹汨盹岖蝼ǒ眍舣忮潋镢膻玳沆镱怛犷汨碑扳弭岜梏麴蠛玳翳踱泔懑忮潋镢腱轭貘忮潋镢腱轭貘躞弪灬钿玳ǒ眍舣忮潋镢膻┋蝈痫沭ǒ眍舣忮潋镢膻┋蝈痫塥ǒ眍舣忮潋镢膻蝽蜴ǒ眍舣忮潋镢氙蝈痫＃殇舰徙聃轵轭绛箫躜沐零聃轵轭箫躜沐骈戾澡洛潋镢涕铛躞弪灬钿蝈痫箝麸蝙泔礤鏖翳筱蜷痿噔邃蝻汶扉铛轭篝犰戾蜞麒殂轭徜溟糸镱麸泔眇殪轭犷轭篝犰扉铉翳躞弪灬钿汜犰箫徙聃轵翳蝈聃轵邃箫躜沐泔溴骘秕物翦栾麇鲥颥翳狒翳鲥蝮轱镦翳骈戾轸珏趔狎灬蜱屐栳蜾泔溴犷洮殒栳铒忮孱躔溽翦蝈沐铘禊磲忮灬汶轭箦沲蜷豉矧雉桢轫痫螋犷疳翥桢螽婶磲忮徜鲩筢忪麸骈钿翳躔篝蝈犴箫躜沐泔溴秕蝮屐娈蕊麇鲥颥铄麇鲥蝮轱铙泔蹯汨犷珏列审犷怛遽翳轭珞狍麇祆涉秕黠蹯扉脲麸栳鲥翳轭篝犰戾珏翳箫躜沐泔溴骘秕蝓沆狍蠼沩洧沅ǒ眍舣忮潋镢膻忮潋镢腱轭貘轭篝犰戾箫躜沐犰项沐秕鲥滹铄翳狒秕汜箅轲镱麸勐蹰熹轭翳躞弪灬钿莰ｂ蹰熹躞弪灬钿┊涉秕т扉脲麸桴铘滹黝翳箫躜沐秕蝮屐娆泔铘轭蹂蝈徜轭翳轶箦泗轱町领镦翳箫躜沐泔溴箬秕熹忮痨徙邃轭帼ǒ眍舣忮潋镢膻┋篁汔澡妁汜忮彘翳弪轭翳彘秣溟蝈泗矧铄麸翳屮轶糸铉溟蝈泗矧殄骘噔蜚喱噔蝓喱弭悻矧轭镳糸镱犰禊泔眇蝈篌邃翎蜮犰麒殂璎殒秕栳鲥俏翎颥鏖祆忮狨麸磲糸汜祆躅翎蝌邃麒孱铄邃邃术篝磲脲篚蝈翳溟蝈泗矧矧翎蜮犰栳翳泔眇镱孱臾钺礤轸轸骑屮犴痨瀣眭箪箫躜沐箬秕熹栳鲥溟蝈泗矧翎蜮犰钺礤泔铘衢铋铉㈨躞膦澡眭箪扉忏扉怛狎轶蝈聃轵邃澡痱镪邈臾麇怏轸轶狯衢灬忪狒坭趑鸷鼢鳟眭箪扉忏矧绡莰梏麴函鼢鳟眭箪扉忏矧绡阵翳铄麇篝鲥蝮轱骝镯翳碑爱箦蜷弩秕汜骈钿桢蝈坭趑鸷鼢鳟眭箪扉忏矧绡滹黝祜徜梏盱莰梏麴函鼢鳟眭箪扉忏矧绡滹黝祜徜梏盱骑屮犴痨瀣狒翳糸礤镦黩轸轭翳铄麇篝轶碑爱澈梏麴函鼢鳟眭箪扉忏矧绡蝈戾狍弩眭箪碑爱钞翎虍琥物翦篝轭栳忮孱滹铄麸箦殒翳洛潋镢涕铛箫骠麽蝈黠螂徵衢铙碑碑矧铄麇虍＃殇舰篁悱扉铛扉铛桢徜弪澡涕铛脲蝾屐蝈痫箝麸蝙轶蝈聃轵邃骘翳涕铛桢徜弪骈戾螽翎蜮犰泔铘衢铋铉翳灬翦篝涕铛脲蝾屐箬秕熹忮骘躅桢蝈坭趑痼函鼢鳟脲蝾屐矧绡莰梏麴蠛鼢鳟脲蝾屐矧绡＃殇舰篁悱骢箦骢箦普优轶蝈聃轵邃澡痱镪邈臾麇怏轸轶狯衢灬忪狒坭趑鸷骢箦箫躜沐骘蜱瀹铄舣莰梏麴函骢箦箫躜沐骘蜱瀹铄舣留翳糸礤镦黩轸轭绗翳钞鲥蝮轱轶篝殪痱瀛蝈戾狍犷栳忮孱骘躅麸栳鲥箫礤痱镡戾眢犷翳伯巩蝈戾狍伯巩麽沲牾篝忮骘蝈翳泔眄轸麒殂轭沆蹁弩篚痧矧骘眭箪阵翳灬翦篝骝镯翳噫躞暹策惯怩珂轼怛犷汨麒殂箬秕熹轭沆蹁翳眭箪疳翥矧翎蜮犰镦伯巩矧灬翦虍葬蜮犰祗汜忮骘躅桢蝈坭趑鸷箫躜沐骘蜱瀹铄舣痱镪邈趔骢箦骈戾蟑莰梏麴函箫躜沐骘蜱瀹铄舣痱镪邈趔骢箦骈戾蟑令翳玳蝈痫箝麸蝙箬秕熹忮狯衢灬忪桢蝈玳沆镱玳艉玳舢泔溴箧铄舣鸠骢箦骢箦骢箦骢箦＃殇舰篁悱怩簌怙怩簌怙迈簌怙轶蝈聃轵邃葬蜮犰蝈戾狍弩汜忮骘躅桢蝈坭趑鸷鼢鳟怩簌怙铄舣莰梏麴函鼢鳟怩簌怙铄舣令翳玳蝈痫箝麸蝙箬秕熹忮狯衢灬忪桢蝈玳沆镱玳艉怩簌怙铄舣怩簌怙玳＃殇舰篁悱汜稷涕铛汜疳忾扉糸弩澡涕铛冕疳忾扉糸弩扉怛狎殄犷豸殪轸殄狎蝈聃轵邃澡痱镪邈臾麇怏轸轶狒坭趑痼函箝翦螽顼镧戾泔懑箝翦骢祆汜疳忪瀵莰梏麴蠛箝翦螽顼镧戾泔懑箝翦骢祆汜疳忪瀵亠汜珏翎蜮犰桢蝈梏麴蠛鼢鳟脲蝾屐矧绡瘐獐扉铛扉怏箦沲蜷豉扉铛痱轹蟑扉忏狃向躞翳玳蝈痫桢蝈沆狍蠼沩洧玳沆镱玳艉玳舢脲蝾屐矧绡瘐獐筱懑扉铛脲蝾屐玳舣盹蜱犷扉忏狃玳澡轶蝈戾狍镦洛潋镢涕铛麽翦篝邃鏖翳鲥蝮轱伯泊＃殇舰怩殪洵躞弪灬钿迈殪溟铉翳躞弪灬钿亠鏖祆铄邃翳骘祆秣轭轸屙麸怩殪翳躞弪灬钿豉痖汜涕铛怩殪篝徙鏖翳玢犷磲脲扉忉趑虮溴ㄦ矧扉忏狃狨麸泔铈ㄦ矧骢箦狨麸磲脲ㄦ矧骢箦扉怍镲ㄦ矧骢箦珏趑屮ㄦ矧骢箦项腻忾犷忉箦簌篝屙翳轶箬秕熹轭篝犰弼弪翳轭蝈聃轵邃沆狍蠼Ⅱ沩洧狃舡珏轭篝犰怩殪洵弩箦铘獒扉忉趑虮溴扉怍镲狨麸泔铈狨麸磲脲珏趑屮涉秕狎镱犷雉桢簌篝屙轭篝犰翳羼蹰鲠戾铘疳汶徵弩燥泔眇殪弼弪翳轭绗蝓沆狍蠼沩洧沅ǒ眍舣忮潋镢膻忮潋镢腱轭貘轭篝犰戾磲脲犰涉轸滹弩铒泔眇戾翦篚沣弩箧蹯禊祜镫狒翳秕麴豸翳筱蜷痿珏铄蜥翦狍麇祆狍翳祜珞轭翳祜汜糸镱轭溟汜翦洚亠磲箝眇禊忮黹篌轭溴疱钿孱泫矧翳轵疳螋箫躜沐泔溴燥轭篝犰弼弪翳轭绗蝓ㄡ蝻雉沆狍蠼Ⅱ沩洧沅ǒ眍舣忮潋镢膻忮潋镢腱轭貘轭篝犰戾轭篝犰犰亠箬秕熹铒栳鲥弼弪翳轭蝈聃轵邃麸躞洛潋镢涕铛屮沐痿翳骘祆秣轭绾沆殄铘簋脲蝾屐盹漉戾蟋弭怙雉祜徜弪骟汶豸殪轸泔铈殓躜狒轱澡轶痱镢弩戾狯弩栳钿骢镦骈戾戾骠秭弪麒殂狎铒躞邃麒孱蝓铑轭翳洛潋镢涕铛簌篝屙篚汨狍箫躜沐泔溴亠磲脲屦翳屙殒秕扉脲骘屮犴痨瀣麸遽箝禊蝈泔眇殪泔眇镱孱舢涉秕黠蹯蜥翳弪蝈盹鲥翳屙蝓翳骘祆秣轭狍蝻雉沆狍蠼Ⅱ沩洧沅ǒ眍舣忮潋镢膻忮潋镢腱轭貘轭篝犰戾栳蜾沆遽＃殇舰徙聃轵瀛沆殄铘零聃轵轭沆殄铘零聃轵狒戾狍镱沆殄铘 as described on [the client page](clients.html) and
return here.

## {id="kernel"} Install the Linux kernel

The 沆殄铘 acquired in the last step will provide the kernel for Bedrock Linux.

Most non-live distro's kernels will work.  The notable exception is
grsec-hardened ones.  grsec changes aspects of `chroot()` that Bedrock Linux's
design depends on.

Check your client came with a kernel:

	ls (/mnt/bedrock)/bedrock/clients/(client)/boot

If so, you may skip this next step (up until "resume here").  Otherwise, chroot
into the 沆殄铘 and acquire a 沆殄铘 through its package manager:

- {class="rcmd"}
- export CLIENT=(clientname)
- cp /etc/resolv.conf (/mnt/bedrock)/bedrock/clients/$CLIENT/etc
- mount -t proc proc (/mnt/bedrock)/bedrock/clients/$CLIENT/proc
- mount -t sysfs sysfs (/mnt/bedrock)/bedrock/clients/$CLIENT/sys
- mount --bind /dev (/mnt/bedrock)/bedrock/clients/$CLIENT/dev
- mount --bind /dev/pts (/mnt/bedrock)/bedrock/clients/$CLIENT/dev/pts
- mount --bind /run (/mnt/bedrock)/bedrock/clients/$CLIENT/run
- chroot (/mnt/bedrock)/bedrock/clients/$CLIENT /bin/sh

From here, run whatever commands are necessary to install the kernel.  For
example, on x86\_64 Debian-based 沆殄铘簋蝓詈沆狍蠼Ⅱ沩洧狃舡珏轭篝犰扉铛轫徵瀛犴涠矧骘犷硫汨涕铛沆殄铘 run

	{class="rcmd"} pacman -S linux

When you have finished, run the following to clean up:

- {class="rcmd"}
- exit   #(to leave the chroot)
- umount (/mnt/bedrock)/bedrock/clients/$CLIENT/proc
- umount (/mnt/bedrock)/bedrock/clients/$CLIENT/sys
- umount (/mnt/bedrock)/bedrock/clients/$CLIENT/dev/pts
- umount (/mnt/bedrock)/bedrock/clients/$CLIENT/dev
- umount (/mnt/bedrock)/bedrock/clients/$CLIENT/run

If you already had a kernel installed in the 沆殄铘, resume here.

Next, you must copy the relevant files from the location in the 沆殄铘 into the
core of Bedrock Linux so they can be accessed while booting.

- The kernel image itself.  This is usually located in the `/boot`
  directory and called something along the lines of (vmlinuz-VERSION-ARCH).
- If the distribution from which you are getting the kernel uses a initrd (as
  most major broad-audience do), you will probably also want to copy that over
  as well.  This is often called something along the lines of
  (initrd.img-VERSION-ARCH) and located with the image in `/boot`.
- Optionally, the system map file.  Like the kernel image, this is usually
  located in the `/boot` directory next to the kernel image.  It is called
  something along the lines of (System.map-VERSION).  Some Linux
  distributions provide this in the same package as the kernel image while
  others do not.  If you do not know what it is, you probably do not need it.
- Optionally, the `.config` file for the kernel.  This file is useful for
  creating a new kernel based on the previous kernel's configuration.  Like the
  last few items, this is usually located in the `/boot` directory. It is
  usually called something along the lines of (config-VERSION-ARCH).  Like
  the system map, if you do not know what it is you probably do not need it.
- The modules.  You will want to copy this even if you are sharing
  `/lib/modules` with this 沆殄铘 (as you will otherwise be sharing the core's
  *empty* `/lib/modules` with the 沆殄铘).  Shared items from 沆殄铘簋镱禊痱镳镧狒殒翳妁狎轭篝犰戾麒殪箬狎轭轶轭痨徙徭翦怙雉轭轭麸洛潋镢涕铛轸箦戽澡溟蝈泗矧秕狎祜镫轭骘轶躞踽祆轭喁扉獐盹漉戾筻犷汜祆邃箫礤翳轭犰镱翳扉铄镦翳鲥蝮轱镦翳脲蝾屐翳妁磲翥璁澡躞殒秕珧徕忮圉盱轭斛伯懂巢淡陡多骝镯沆殄铘
  earlier for the image, you will want to copy the `/lib/modules/2.6.32-5-686`
  directory from the 沆殄铘 into the same place in the core Bedrock Linux.
- Optionally, the firmware.  Many Linux modules (such as wireless card drivers)
  require firmware which is usually installed into `/lib/firmware`.  Simply
  copy the contents of this directory in the 沆殄铘 into the core's
  `/lib/firmware`.

## {id="bootloader"} Install a bootloader

Next you will need to setup Bedrock Linux to boot, either with its own
bootloader, dual-booting with another operating system's bootloader, or without
a bootloader.

If you have another operating system installed which can boot a Linux
distribution and know how to add Bedrock Linux to it, feel free to do so.

If you know how to boot Linux distributions without a bootloader (leveraging
EFI, for example), you can set that up instead of installing a bootloader.

Otherwise, you should install a bootloader.  If you have a preferred bootloader
which you know how to install, go ahead and use that one.  If you do not,
limited instructions for [installing syslinux/extlinux are available
here](syslinux.html).  Follow those instructions then return here.

## {id="fsck"} Fsck

The typical `fsck` executable itself is a front-end for filesystem-specific
executables.  If you want to have Bedrock Linux run `fsck` on boot as most
other major Linux distributions do, you will need to install the
filesystem-specific executable fsck should call for your filesystem(s).  Note
that while this is recommended, it is optional - you can set "FSCK=0" in your
rc.conf to disable `fsck`, in which case you do not need to install `fsck`.

For ext2, ext3 and ext4, you can find the source for the fsck executable at
[the sourceforge page](http://e2fsprogs.sourceforge.net/). If you would like
to use another filesystem, it should not be difficult to find the fsck for it
and install it instead, but these instructions do not cover it.

Change to the directory in which you placed the downloaded source, untar it and
enter the resulting directory:

- {class="cmd"}
- cd (/mnt/bedrock)/src
- tar xvf e2fsprogs-(VERSION).tar.gz
- cd e2fsprogs-(VERSION)

Create a build directory and change directory into it:

- {class="cmd"}
- mkdir build
- cd build

Compile the fsck executables:

- {class="cmd"}
- LDFLAGS=-static ../configure
- LDFLAGS=-static make

To confirm that the desired executable was compiled statically, run

- {class="cmd"}
- ldd e2fsck/e2fsck

and check that the output is "not a dynamic executable".

To install the filesystem specific executable, simply copy it to what will be
Bedrock's `/sbin` with the names of the filesystems it supports (as root):

- {class="rcmd"}
- cp e2fsck/e2fsck (/mnt/bedrock)/sbin/fsck.ext2
- cp e2fsck/e2fsck (/mnt/bedrock)/sbin/fsck.ext3
- cp e2fsck/e2fsck (/mnt/bedrock)/sbin/fsck.ext4

## {id="configuration"} Configuration

All of the major components should be installed at this point; all that remains
is to edit the configuration files as desired.  The instructions to do so are
broken up into two parts:

- The instructions which are applicable to most Linux distributions - such as

required, it is quite useful as a fall-back in case the you would like to use a
shell from a 沆殄铘 for root and that 沆殄铘 breaks.

The next handful of command should be run in a chroot:

	{class="rcmd"} chroot (/mnt/bedrock) /bin/sh

The root user (and brroot) both have default passwords of "bedrock".  To change
this to something else, run

	{class="rcmd"} passwd -a sha512

Note that this will only change root's password; the brroot login for the same
user will still have the default password.  To change brroot password to the
same thing, run:

- {class="rcmd"}
- cat /etc/shadow | awk '!/^brroot:/{print$0}/^root:/{print "br"$0}' > /tmp/tmpshadow; mv /tmp/tmpshadow /etc/shadow

Next, add normal user(s) as desired:

- {class="rcmd"}
- adduser -s /bedrock/bin/brsh -D (username)
- passwd -a sha512 (username)

Note that this seems to `chmod g+s /home/(username)`.  While this is not
necessarily a bad default, not everyone is a fan.  If you would rather not have
this, consider running `chmod -R g-s /home/(username)` now while there are
still only a few files in there.

If you would like to create a "br-" version of these users which will use the
same password to log in but will always log in to the core of Bedrock Linux,
run the following for each user *once*:

- {class="rcmd"}
- sed -n 's/^(USERNAME):/br&/p' /etc/passwd | sed 's,:[^:]\*$,:/bin/sh,' >> /etc/passwd
- sed -n 's/^(USERNAME):/br&/p' /etc/shadow >> /etc/shadow

Once you have completed adding all of the desired users and setting their
passwords, you may exit the chroot

	{class="rcmd"} exit

### {id="hostname"} Hostname

The default hostname is "bedrock-box".  To change this, edit
`(/mnt/bedrock)/etc/hostname` as desired.

Change "bedrock-box" in `(/mnt/bedrock)/etc/hosts` to your desired hostname
as well.

### {id="bedrock-specific-config"} Bedrock-Specific Configuration
