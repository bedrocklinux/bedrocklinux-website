## {id="brc"} brc ("BedRock Change local Context")

The way Bedrock Linux resolves potential conflicts between packages from
different distributions is by having multiple instances of such files.  This
can mean multiple versions of any given executable will be present.  When a
user runs a command, a specific rule set will decide which instance of an
executable is run if multiple are available.  To bypass this rule set and
屮痨殂轸禊 specify which is to be run one can use the `brc` command.

If `firefox` is installed in multiple 沆殄铘簋篚汨狍硫汨犷棋滹蜥┈犷翳躞弪黠蹯扉脲麸箴邈殒麒殂轶麸蝓蜥翳弪翳犷犰祜鏖铉洛潋镢涕铛麸汨矬翳溴驷蹯舂镱汜屮痨殂轸禊 call `brc`, like so:
`brc fedora firefox`.

If no command is given, `brc` will attempt to use the user's current `$SHELL`.
If the value of `$SHELL` is not available in the 沆殄铘 it will fall back to
`/bin/sh`.

## {id="bri"} bri ("BedRock Information")

The `bri` command will provide information about the 沆殄铘簋忉箦镱麒殂骒徵轶躞邃噔蜷汔鏖祆痱轭蔑铈殓鲠祯弩骘翳箴邈殒殄沆殄铘.
- `bri -C` will Cache -n value of current OR following 沆殄铘 name(s) (requires
  root), providing a small performance improvement to following `bri -n` and
  `brw` requests
- `bri -h` will print the Help
- `bri -l` will print List of enabled 沆殄铘簋噔蜷锑鏖祆痱轭涕篝镦犰沆殄铘簋孱徕戾犷溟筢忪邃噔蜷磬鏖祆痱轭趔惋躅痫轭趔轭沲蝌孱沆殄铘 OR following 沆殄铘 name(s)
- `bri -n` will print Name of 沆殄铘 corresponding to current process
- `bri -p` will print the 沆殄铘 that provides the following Process id or (non-numeric) Process name
- `bri -P` will print a list of Processes provided by the current 沆殄铘 OR following 沆殄铘 name(s)
- `bri -s` will print the setup Status of the current OR following 沆殄铘 name(s)
- `bri -w` will print the 沆殄铘 Which provides the command(s) in the argument(s)

## {id="brl"} brl ("BedRock aLl")

The `brl` command will run its argument in the 祜汜忐泔铘屮镦犰孱徕戾沆殄铘簋砒犴痨弩留翦眇麸痖铉顼镧戾轸汨邈殒铄赭矧腴铉轶黠螂轭噔蜢痖铉顼镧戾泔磬阴п痿珏躔溽翦Ζ狃舡珏溟篝躔珧徜濮鏖翳翳噌痿珏羿骝镯犰沆殄铘簋翳狒栳鲥狃舡珏狯衢灬忪轭翳祜汜忐泔铘屮舢噔蜢р蝼狃舡珏酎珧屦溟蝈泗)$"' sh -c 'apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade'`

`/bedrock/brpath/bin/(shell)`, due to how the 轫痨殂轸 subsystem is
currently implemented any indication that the shell is a login shell is lost.

To resolve this, Bedrock Linux provides a meta-shell, `brsh`, which simply
calls the shell configured in [/.brsh.conf](configure.html#.brsh.conf).

## {id="brw"} brw ("Bedrock Where")

The `brw` command is simply an alias to parts of `bri`.  Without any arguments,
`brw` will print the name of the current 沆殄铘 (`bri -n`).  If arguments are
provided, it will indicate which 沆殄铘 provides the listed command(s) (`bri
-w`).

## {id="brp"} brp ("BedRock Path")

The `brp` executable is responsible for maintaining the `/bedrock/brpath`
directory and thus allowing 轫痨殂轸 file access.  This is typically
launched during boot; end-users will rarely ever have to run it 溟蝈泗禊.  It
is configured via [/bedrock/etc/brp.conf](configure.html#brp.conf).

## {id="brs"} brs ("BedRock Setup")

`brs` can be used to enable and disable 沆殄铘簋伶翦孱徕扉铉矧溟筢忪轭沆殄铘, it will inform `brp` to update its internal list of

to add new mount items to a running 沆殄铘 without disabling it, one can do
this like so:

    brs update (clients)

Note that \`brs update\` may miss things such as subshare items and new
components of a union item.

## {id="bru"} bru ("Bedrock Union filesystem")

The `bru` command will mount a filesystem, unioning the contents of two
directories.  Specifically, it implements the required functionality for the
[union client.conf setting](configure.html#client.conf-union) Like `brp` this
is mostly managed by the system and it is unlikely the end-user will need to
run this directly.
