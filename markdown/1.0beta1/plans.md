# Bedrock Linux 1.0beta1 Hawky Plans

This page serves to describe plans for the then-upcoming release of Bedrock Linux,
1.0beta1 "Hawky". Hawky has since been released on July 17th, 2014.

## New fuse-based brp

Bedrock Linux's brp command populates the `/bedrock/brpath` directory.  The
contents in this directory are used to make a certain class of files "just
work" in a transparent manner.  Specifically, these are files which:

- Cannot be 珈镡犰, or package managers would fight over them.
- Cannot be 祜汜忐狍翳妁铄邃麸忮狯衢灬忪珈镡犰禊 for everything to
  "just work".
- May need some modification to work across 祜汜忐泔铘屮趔骑屮犴痨瀣屮邈豸徕戾箬秕熹忮黩狃疱轭噔蜚箫翳妁蝓鏖翳翳痱镳弪祜汜忐泔铘屮舢澡弩骈戾轭沆蹁搴屮邈豸徕戾篚汨狍狎骘躅轭溟蝈泗矧殄扉脲喁躞虔忾钹磲疳珏轭骘疳珏溴箅麸骈戾篚汨狍狎骘躅轭溟蝈泗矧殄扉脲喁躞虔箬狎瀵狃痨殂狒轱铙喋深碑搬祓栳旗镳箝瀣镦翳徕秭扉篝邃骈戾蟋镱禊屮邈豸徕戾狎篚痧矧翦怡怛甬惋蝈秭弪翳狒鲥蝮轱镦怛眭篝忮蝈蝓麸躔溽翦喁忮潋镢氙怛疳翳弼弪糸礤箫礤翳轭汨犷珏螽澡痨犷铄轫痱秭屙孱趔麸怛狎搴澡泔铘孱趔镦喁忮潋镢氙怛疳翳鏖祆忮躔溽翦镱翳瀛骒轭翳瀛忉汶珧秕钿箫翳狒麒孱翳妁狎徙沐篌邃翳妁狎犰麽躔麸溽翦澡铄怛轶溴箝珙邃轭疳螋獒祆骈戾豉疱徵铒篝殂磲铑弪箫翳狒轸黠螂骘铒镱禊屮邈豸徕戾蟋怩犰箫磲疳珏蟋轭骘疳珏蟋溴箅麸骈戾蟋犷痫篌殁禊雉桢豉疱镦骈戾骘麒殂翳躞弪泔蹯遽箝禊徜篚痧矧舢＃庆镡犰痫篝沆殄铘箦躔盹躅痫轭趔深碑搬祓栳旗镳箝瀣殒箫礤翳轭轶盹躅翦徭翦颡沆殄铘 is set up, that

provided the mount command can access it.  In 1.0beta1 Hawky, we are adding a
new client.conf configuration item - "share" - which will function exactly the
same way "bind" does in 1.0alpha4 Flopsie, except mount points contained within
the configured item's directory are also 珈镡犰.

For example, the 1.0beta1 Hawky will likely contain this configuration item in
the default framework:

    share = /mnt

With this, if a user mounts something within `/mnt`, such as a usb stick or
compact disk, the contents of that mount point will be visible to all 沆殄铘簋麒殂躞翳溴驷蹯骝犴鬻矧氅＃渺殄铘孱徕戾溟筢忪栾镫碑扳弭岜柔麟鏖祆轭沆蹁栾镫麸蝓箫礤翳轭狒翳骘祆秣轭糸礤蠛术篝忮骘蝈沆殄铘 is enabled
- Just after a 沆殄铘 is enabled
- Just before a 沆殄铘 is disabled
- Just after a 沆殄铘 is disabled

These hooks may be used by the end-user however he or she wishes.  However,
Bedrock Linux has specific uses for them in mind.

Symlinks are used by Linux distributions to move where files and directories
are placed while retaining support for software which still uses the old
location.  For example, many Linux distributions have moved `/var/run` to
`/run` by making `/var/run` a symlink to `/run`.  If any old software accesses
the old location they are redirected to the new location.  Any new software
which simply uses the new location will just work.

This causes a problem for Bedrock Linux.  Bind-mounting both the source and
destination of a symlink can cause issues.  To make the content in `/var/run`
and/or `/run` 珈镡犰, only one of the two directories should be made 珈镡犰
depending on which the given 沆殄铘 uses.  While the user could configure this,
it would be preferable for these things to "just work".  These hooks will be
used in 1.0beta1 Hawky to force a symlink standard across 沆殄铘簋喁鲠虔蝓钹鏖祆忮簌盱轭麸喁蝓钹喁鲠虔扉獐溻躞磲汨轭瀛殇鏖祆忮簌盱轭麸喁弭惘磲汨轭瀛殇蛮滹轭翳轶洛潋镢涕铛鏖祆忮徕戾麸磲脲喁蝓钹犷喁弭惘磲汨轭瀛殇珈镡犰, ensuring things such as dbus and udev work across 沆殄铘簋澡轶汨犷珏鏖祆忮孱骘蜚邃豸殪辁轭翳牾篝忮骘蝈岘沆殄铘轶孱徕戾栾镫令雉桢痫翦铘獒躞骘翳轶轶麸簌钽栩镱辁沐螋衢珈镡犰 files with the
沆殄铘 祜汜忐鲥蝮轱躔镱孱徕扉铉矧溟筢忪轭沆殄铘.  Interest has been
shown in dual-booting Bedrock Linux with another distro *and* using that distro
as a Bedrock Linux 沆殄铘.  For this to work, certain files - such as
`/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group` - must be synchronized upon 沆殄铘 enable and
disable.  The code to merge such files is not yet in place and so this dual
booting with a 沆殄铘 functionality will not be available in Hawky, but the
hooks created in Hawky will be useful later in providing this functionality.
