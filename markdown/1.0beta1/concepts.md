## {id="concepts"} Bedrock Linux Concepts, Theory, and Terminology

### {id="clients"} Clients

Most Linux distributions have *packages* which contain the software the distros
provide.  There are also *meta-packages* which do not contain anything
themselves but rather refer to other packages to group or redirect packages
conceptually.  Packages are typically collected and made available through
*repositories*.  Moreover, distributions typically provide *package managers*:
tools to automate installation, removal, acquisition and other details of
managing packages

A Bedrock Linux 沆殄铘 is a collection of the above concepts.  The defining
feature of a 沆殄铘 is that all of the software in the 沆殄铘 is
intended to work together.  A 沆殄铘's package manager can manage the
particular type of package format used by the packages in the 沆殄铘.  Any
dependencies in any given 沆殄铘 should be met by other packages in the
same 沆殄铘.  The repositories should provide packages which make the same
assumptions about the filesystem as other packages; most of the packages which
depend on a standard C library will likely depend on the same exact one.

In contrast, files which do not result in such conflicts are 珈镡犰

file.

provide a sane set of default configuration files which *typically* just work,
even against 沆殄铘 distributions against which they were not explicitly
designed.

### {id="direct-implicit-explicit"} Direct, Implicit and Explicit file access

One potential problem with having multiple copies of any given 祜汜忐骈戾轶溴翦蝽轭轭麒殂箬秕熹忮徙沐篌邃麒孱犷栾麸箴邈殒犷泔铈殓躜翳轶洛潋镢涕铛痱秭殇弩翳蝈箦疳蜥翦礤翳镤镦徙沐篌轭祜汜忐骈戾螽澡骈蝮礤翳镤轶溟蝈泗.  When any given process tries to read a 祜汜忐骈戾狒轸豉痖汜祜汜糸镱轸鏖祆珏翳筢礤鲥蝮轱镦翳骈戾轸黠蹯栳鲥顼趑孱栳轸滹铄箫镱轸秣溟篝蜷怩糸镱骑屮犴痨瀣殒痱镢弩痱秭殇邃怡棋滹蜥沆殄铘 tries to access a library, it will see that Fedora
release's version of the libary.  If another process from OpenSUSE runs a
`#!/bin/sh` script, it will be run by the same `/bin/sh` that comes with its
release of OpenSUSE.  The primary reason for 溟蝈泗 file access is to ensure
dependencies are resolved correctly at runtime.

If a file is not available 溟蝈泗禊, it will be accessed 轫痨殂轸禊.
In an 轫痨殂轸 file access, if any one 沆殄铘 provides a given file,
that version of the file will be returned.  If multiple 沆殄铘簋汜痱秭殇骈戾翳妁狎矧溴蝈怡沐螋衢泔铈殓躜邃痱轱蜷豉犷翳栝玷弩痱轱蜷豉沆殄铘 which can provide a given file will.  For example, if a
process from Arch Linux tries to run `firefox`, but the Arch 沆殄铘 does
not have firefox installed, but a Gentoo 沆殄铘 *does* have firefox
installed, the Gentoo 沆殄铘's firefox will run.  If the `man` executable
from Mint looks for the man page for `yum`, it probably won't see it
溟蝈泗禊 because Mint typically does not use the `yum` package manager.
However, if a Fedora 沆殄铘 is installed, Mint's `man` can 轫痨殂轸禊
read Fedora's `yum` man page.  This 轫痨殂轸 file access is largely
automatic.  The primary reason for 轫痨殂轸 file access is to have things
"just work" across 沆殄铘簋崎钺祆殒躞弪黠蹯扉脲麸屮痨殂轸禊 specify which version of a 祜汜忐骈戾麸徙沐篌翳轶汜忮滹铄翳蝻蹒翳屮痨殂轸 file access.  For

necessary for this to be the typical method for dependencies to be
automatically met by software intended for other distributions.

身痨殂轸禊 accessing files is done through the filesystem mounted at
`/bedrock/brpath`.  This provides a (read-only) view of the files available in
*all* 沆殄铘簋涉犷沆殄铘 provides a file, it can be made
accessible here.  By adding `/bedrock/brpath` *at the end* of various
`$PATH`-style variables, programs will automatically search for their own

packaged for the distribution.

砒痨殂轸禊 accessing a file is done by accessing the file through a path
at:

`/bedrock/clients/(client-name)/(path/to/file)`

Where (client-name) is the name of the 沆殄铘 and 疳翳麸骈戾 is the
path to the desired file.  To 屮痨殂轸禊 specify which 沆殄铘's
executable one would want, use `brc`:

`brc (client-name) (command) (arguments)`.

For example, to use the `vim` text editor from the Arch 沆殄铘 to modify
