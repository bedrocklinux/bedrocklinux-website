Bedrock Linux
=============

Bedrock Linux is a meta Linux distribution which allows users to utilize
features from other, typically mutually exclusive distributions.  Essentially,
users can mix-and-match components as desired.  For example, one could have:

- The bulk of the system from an old/stable distribution such as CentOS or Debian.
- Access to cutting-edge packages from Arch Linux.
- Access to Arch's AUR.
- The ability to automate compiling packages with Gentoo's portage
- Library compatibility with Ubuntu, such as for desktop-oriented proprietary software.
- Library compatibility with CentOS, such as for workstation/server oriented proprietary software.

All at the same time, all working together like one, largely cohesive operating system.

A new video demonstrating such features as of the newly released Bedrock Linux
0.7 Poki is currently in development and will be listed here in the future.
