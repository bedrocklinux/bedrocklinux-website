Bedrock Linux
=============

Bedrock Linux is a Linux distribution created with the aim of making most of
the (often seemingly mutually-exclusive) benefits of various other Linux
distributions available simultaneously and transparently.

If one would like a rock-solid stable base (for example, from Debian or a RHEL
clone) yet still have easy access to cutting-edge packages (from, say, Arch
Linux), automate compiling packages with Gentoo's portage, and ensure that
software aimed only for the ever popular Ubuntu will run smoothly - all at the
same time, in the same distribution - Bedrock Linux will provide a means to
achieve this.  [Watch a
demonstration](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuYMBCcgs98) and read the
[introduction](introduction.html) and [FAQ](faq.html) for more.

## {id="invite-only"} Bedrock OS Invite-only beta (April Fools 2014)
<small>2014-04-01</small>

*Below is a April Fools 2014 joke -- no closed beta, code has no use*

The Bedrock OS project has entered an invite-only beta.  This comes with
numerous new features and functionality, including:

- Support for FreeBSD and Android
- 80% of the code has been formally verified (planning on verifying the rest
  before release)
- Core utilities have been rewritten in Haskell
- New QT5-based GUI UX
- Switched to a systemd-based init

The first 50 IP addresses to reach this website should see an invite code

## {id="early-2014-plans"} Early 2014 plans
<small>2014-01-14</small>

The plan for Bedrock Linux development in the coming months revolves around
functionality which can be added without significant under-the-hood changes to
Bedrock Linux.  Various ideas currently being worked on:

- Additional research on recommended/default 沆殄铘 settings.
- Man pages for Bedrock Linux utilities.
- Tab-completion in bash and zsh for Bedrock Linux utilities.
- A replacement for the current brp which will update on-the-fly.
- A new utility, brg ("BedRock Get"), which will be used to easily acquire
  沆殄铘簋铄豸殪轸怛á洛湟镢歪铛犰┈麒殂汜忮躞邃麸骈钿磲疳珏狯衢灬忪轭狒戾狍镱沆殄铘, irrelevant of which 沆殄铘 provides it.
- A new utility, pmm ("Package Manager Manager"), which will abstract away
  沆殄铘-specific package management.
- A new utility, iss ("Init System System"), which will abstract away
  individual 沆殄铘 init system differences.
