			<p>
				The bind mount sharing system does not allow moving or
				renaming on top of mount points.  This is a primarily an
				issue with files such as <code>/etc/passwd</code>.  The
				most common ways to update such files involve creating a
				temporary new file and move/renaming it over the old one.
				This is advantageous as it minimizes the window of time in
				which something could go wrong and leave a malformed
				<code>/etc/passwd</code>.  However, it does not function
				with bind mount sharing.  One cannot share all of
				<code>/etc</code>, as other files in there need to be
				unique per client.  One can manually update these files,
				either by simply editing them with a text editor or by
				updating them in core Bedrock Linux.  This issue is
				particularly troubling when packages in clients attempt to
				create users or groups.  For the time being, one must
				manually add the users/groups in a way which does not
				conflict with the bind mount issue and then re-run the
				package installation command in the clients.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>Possible Solution</em>: This problem is particularly
				troubling when packages try to add users or groups to
				shared /etc/passwd and /etc/group.  Perhaps we could just
				ensure that the users/groups are already there, so there is
				no need to add them.  This would require building a
				database of all possible users/groups that could be added
				by any package in any distro.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>Possible Solution</em>: Look into unionfs-fuse as
				possible solution.
			</p>
			<h2 id="Difficulty Statically Compiling">Difficulty Statically Compiling</h2>
			<p>
				Difficulty statically compiling busybox and capchroot have
				been noted, somewhat dependent on the client/installer host
				used.  This is caused by conscious limitations placed in
				libraries available in many Linux distributions, particularly
				glibc.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>Possible Solution</em>: Use uclibc to build busybox
				and capchroot.  The downside is that this requires
				significantly more work for distros which do not have
				uclibc readily accessible.  Look into buildroot.
			</p>
			<h2 id="Man pages do not work across clients">Man pages do not work across clients</h2>
			<p>
				No work has yet been done to ensure man pages work across
				clients.  This might be a single bind mount away from
				working.
			</p>
			<h2 id="Debian-based clients: statoverride">Debian-based clients: statoverride</h2>
			<p>
				Occasionally, apt/dpkg will complain about issues with
				"statoverride".  This most likely occures because it expects
				a daemon should be running, but it is not.  This can be fixed
				in this instance by simply removing the contents of
				<code>/var/lib/dpkg/statoverride</code>.  Simply leave an
				empy file in that location.  This may come up repeatedly - no
				work has yet been done to find a permanent solution.
			</p>
			<h2 id="/usr-move'd Clients">/usr-move'd Clients</h2>
			<p>
				A growing number of Linux distributions (such as Arch Linux
				and Fedora) have moved many of the root-level directories
				into <code>/usr</code>.  To enable backwards compatibility,
				they have symlinked the root-level directories into the
				<code>/usr</code> directories.  For example,
				<code>/lib</code> is now symlinked to <code>/usr/lib/</code>.
				Sadly, Bedrock Linux 1.0alpha1 does not properly handle
				bind-mounts into symlinked directories.  This means one
				cannot use bind-mounts to share <code>/lib/modules</code>
				with clients who have undergone the <code>/usr</code> move.
				However, <code>/usr/lib/modules</code> can be shared just
				fine.  If all of the clients have been
				<code>/usr</code>-moved, one can simply share the directories
				within <code>/usr</code> However, if one is using a mix of
				<code>/usr</code>-moved and non-<code>/usr</code>-moved
				clients, difficulties arise.  Try simply copying these
				directories every time one is updated.
			</p>
			<h2 id="Pacman Filesystem Warnings">Pacman Filesystem Warnings</h2>
			<p>
				Arch Linux's package manager, pacman, attempts to detect if
				there is sufficient free disk space available before
				installing or updating packages.  However, it fails to
				successfully do so under this version of Bedrock Linux.  So
				long as sufficient disk space is in fact available, these
				warnings can be safely ignored.
			</p>
			<h2 id="Mount warnings on boot">Mount warnings on boot</h2>
			<p>
				If both <code>AUTO_BRS=1</code> and
				<code>DEVICE_MANAGER=udev</code>, one will receive (harmless)
				warnings on boot.  It is safe to ignore these warnings.  This
				has been fixed in upcoming versions of Bedrock Linux.
