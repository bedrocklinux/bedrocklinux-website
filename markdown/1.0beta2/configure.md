## {id="rc.conf"} rc.conf

The `rc.conf` configuration file, located at `/bedrock/etc/rc.conf`, is used to
populate a number of important environment variables.

### {id="tz"} TZ

`TZ` variable indicates timezone information.  It can be in one of three forms:

- POSIX, e.g. "EST5EDT,M3.2.0,M11.1.0".  For documentation, see:
	- [http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xbd/envvar.html](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xbd/envvar.html) (UNIX)
	- [http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/TZ-Variable.html](http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/TZ-Variable.html) (GNU)
	- [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg3T1000252](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg3T1000252) (AIX)
- Olson, e.g. "America/New_York".  This requires a timezone database in every
  strata, and is thus not recommended.
- A file path to an Olson timezone database file.  By ensuring the database
  is global, all strata will see the same timezone information.  However, since
  various distros will try to independently control the timezone database,
  they may conflict.  Instead, it is recommended to copy the desired Olson
  database file to `/bedrock/etc/localtime` and direct `TZ` to that.  For
  example, copy `/usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New_York` if you are in EST/EDT.

Some software may ignore the `TZ` environment variable and instead attempt to
read `/etc/localtime` to determine the current timezone.  Bedrock Linux will
copy `/bedrock/etc/localtime` to `/etc/localtime` when enabling a 篝蜥趱睨麸泔鲥翳轶痫篌殁殪轸＃殇舰灬铉塘吻渝趔翳灬铉踽珏祜汜戾轭骘蝽狒轱町瀹绠嗵廖墙孱哒赢赵骗膏物翦祜汜戾轭骘蝽狒轱眭篝忮轭篝犰戾浏珏铄蜥翦轭弼弪篝狒蹴, as it

everything should see the same set of files at any of these paths rather than
their own version.  New mount points in any of these directories will also be
treated as 珈镡犰 (`mount --share`'d). e.g.:

    share = /proc, /sys, /dev, /home, /root, /lib/modules, /tmp, /var/tmp, /mnt
    share = /media, /run

### {id="bind"} bind

`bind` is similar to `share` except new mount points made under these
directories are not treated as 珈镡犰.  This is primarily used to avoid
recursion where one 珈镡犰 item is mounted within another.  In general,
anything set to be 珈镡犰 in `/bedrock` should be `bind`'d rather than
`share`'d. e.g.

    bind = /bedrock, /bedrock/brpath, /bedrock/strata/bedrock

Careful with the order - directories should come before what they contain.

### {id="union"} union

One cannot `rename()` the `share` or `bind` items.  This is problematic for some
files in `/etc` which (1) have neighboring items which are 祜汜忐ㄡ钿箫麇汜铑雉箬狎犰镦喁弭汔犷ú麒殂狎躔溽翦鲩囹孱犴濞┼令骈戾麒殂栝翳徕秭赭箝趱狒轱铙箬秕熹忮圊铋镱唰洚项汜怛遽躔囿栳蝈犷噔轭溧轸屙殒翳扉铄珏麸祜铉怩圊铋镱轸屙栳鲥痖汶簌铘狲脲屦犰镦翳轸屙翳狒狎泔铘衢铄轭翳筢礤溟蝈泗矧镱翳筢礤扉铄瀹绠圊铋镱弭愫痱镦殪瀣栾篝钺礤栾篝蟋疳篌麂珧秕瓞箬徜秣篚滹弪蟋蝈箫祧泔铈磲汨轭瀛殇箬屐祗簌篝屙浏簌篝屙眭祠榄躞弪翎蜱弭麽铘蟑忮潋镢氘箦蝣殂瀣祜汜戾泔铈盹翡轶篚瀣矬蝈戾狍瀣祗猸蝈戾狍瀣蜚祜汜爨＃殇舰栾镫螈痱邋钺忪瀵痫篝孱徕戾痱邃轶徕戾痫篝溟筢忪洛潋镢涕铛栳栾镫麸蝓屮邈豸徕戾忮骘蝈徭翦孱徕扉铉溟筢忪轭篝蜥趱懋涉秕黠蹯扉脲麸滹箫礤翳轭篚汨狍孱篚蝈篝蜥趱睨箴邈殒殂盹躅痫轭轶盹躅翦忮骘蝈孱徕扉铉篝蜥趱睨翳弩栾镫泔蹯忮豸殪辁邃麸徙栝弼翳轶骑屮犴痨瀣秕泔蹯汨邈殒犷纹盹躅痫轭轶盹躅翦镱喁忮潋镢氙篝蜥翎铄赭矧脲洵篝蜥趱睨犷洮殒轸轶铒衄盹躅轸牾篝忮骘蝈孱徕扉铉翳篝蜥趱睨亠泔蹯翳孱躅盹躅轸麒孱溟筢忪轭翳篝蜥趱睨瀹绠痱邋钺忪忮潋镢氙箬狎瀵怛蟑骘蜚瀛簌盱轭塍痱邋钺忪忮潋镢氙箬狎瀵怛蟑箦趱瓠弭痱邋钺忪忮潋镢氙箬狎瀵怛蟑蝓瞽祜汶＃殇舰孱徕戾孱徕戾噱钺忪遴轭溟汜翦殒翳玳鲥篝蜥趱睨箬秕熹忮孱徕戾狒怙雉糸礤澡轶汜彘翳弪忮噔镲羿ㄩ钿殂狒轭轸箬秕熹忮孱徕戾狒怙雉糸礤矧囗犷踽爨ㄩ钿殂狒轭轸鏖祆忮孱徕戾浏溟筢忪邃磲铛犰禊┊瀹绠孱徕戾怙雉涉眭祠轲戾噱钺忪遴轸屙狎箦衄翳灬翦篝镱翎脲痱邈殇孱沐澡躞镱汜轭沆蹁噱钺忪怙雉轭骝犴鬻矧膻骝犴鬻矧塍 described below)

The value is the entire line after the `=`; do not place multiple init commands
in the same line separated by `,`'s as one can do with `share`.  Historically,
`/sbin/init` is utilized as the command to run the init; however, systemd
systems seem to prefer `/lib/systemd/system` without a corresponding symlink at
`/sbin/init`. e.g.:

Alias information is read from `/bedrock/etc/aliases.conf` and from the files
found in `/bedrock/etc/aliases.d/`.  Simply indicate the desired alias name

The `brpath` filesystem is used to make files from
other 篝蜥翎 accessible, altering them as necessary so things "just work".
If any 篝蜥翎 provides a file, this file could be made accessilbe through
the `/bedrock/brpath` filesystem for the other 篝蜥翎.

The `[pass]`, `[brc-wrap]` and `[exec-filter]` headings should contain
key-value pairs separated by an equals sign.  The keys will indicate
files/directories that should show up at `/bedrock/brpath`, and the values will
indicate files/directories that will be unioned to populate the mount point's
files.

For the keys, a trailing "/" indicates the item should be a directory (and
thus the values will be used to populate files in the directory).  Otherwise,
the item is treated as a file and the values indicate possible files it could
represent.

For the values, a prefixed 篝蜥趱睨ㄥ绠篝蜥趱睨┖疳翳麸骈戾轭溟汜翦翳鲠祯泔蝌弩痫钿麸翳狒箴邈殒殂篝蜥趱睨骈戾溟蝈泗矧萧桢蝼轶瀣犰镦翳孱徕戾篝蜥翎 will be searched as possible sources
for the file.

The `[stratum-order]` heading should be followed by a list of 篝蜥翎, one
per line.  These indicate the priority order for values that do not have a
`(stratum):` prefix.  Note this does not have to be an exhaustive list - any
enabled 篝蜥翎 not listed will still be used; they will simply be treated as
lower priority than the those listed.

    # untouched.

If you are editing it at
install time - when you're not yet actually running Bedrock Linux - the file
may be at `$GLOBAL/etc/fstab` (e.g. `/bedrock/strata/global/etc/fstab`), and
**not** directly at `/etc/fstab` quite yet.  The latter two should be at
`/bedrock/etc/fstab` irrelevant of the circumstances: either you're hijacking
such that it is on the root, or you're doing a manual install and have made a
symlink for `/bedrock`.

Bedrock Linux provides a menu on boot to let the user choose which init system
to use for the given session.  Naturally this menu must be provided before the
init system is run, which means it must be provided before `/etc/fstab` is
parsed by the init system.  If the init system is on a partition other than the
boot-time root partition, this partition must be mounted by something other
than `/etc/fstab`.  For these mounts Bedrock Linux provides its own pre-init
time fstab file at `/bedrock/etc/fstab`.

Some users prefer to make a partition specifically for `/bedrock/strata` or one
for each 篝蜥翎 within `/bedrock/strata` (e.g. a partition for
`/bedrock/strata/gentoo`, a partition for `/bedrock/strata/slackware`, etc).
Since these partitions can potentially contain init systems,
`/bedrock/etc/fstab` was created specifically to support these workflows.  If
you do not have special partitions for/within `/bedrock/strata`, but rather
kept that directory on the root partition, you probably do not need to worry
about `/bedrock/etc/fstab`.  However, you may still need to worry about the
default framework - keep reading below.

Other common mount points - such as `/home` and `/tmp` - can use `/etc/fstab`
just as they are utilized in other distros.  Nonetheless, if you would like to
have `/bedrock/etc/fstab` mount partitions such as `/home` it can do so.

Be sure not to include the same mount item in *both* `/etc/fstab` *and*
`/bedrock/etc/fstab` - any given mount should only appear in one or the other.
When you place anything in `/bedrock/etc/fstab` make sure you do not also have
it within `/etc/fstab`.

For the most part, `/bedrock/etc/fstab` utilizes the same syntax as the typical
`/etc/fstab`.  However, there are a few special things to keep in mind for
`/bedrock/etc/fstab`:

- `/bedrock/etc/fstab` is mounted by the Bedrock Linux provided busybox
  executable in a limited environment.  It may not understand some less common
  fstab features which would have been understood in `/etc/fstab`.  For those
  features, `/etc/fstab` will be required.  It is possible to run into a
  catch-22 in which some special fstab command that busybox does not
  understand is required to provide a given init - avoid these situations.

- Since `/bedrock/etc/fstab` is mounted so early - before init - various
  Bedrock Linux subsystems are not yet enabled.  For example, the systems in
  place to ensure 珈镡犰 files are available in the same place from
  everyone's point-of-view or that 蝻雉骟 stratum's files are available at
  the explicit path `/bedrock/strata/(rootfs-stratum-name)/` are not yet
  enabled.  Thus, special consideration must be utilized when mounting into
  either the 珈镡犰 or 蝻雉骟 篝蜥翎.

- The 蝻雉骟篝蜥趱睨轶镱翳蝻雉镦翳骈戾簌篝屙趄邋楫瀹喁喱骝镯喁忮潋镢氙弭惘骟翎忄痫轭镦鲩鬻澡躞殒秕黠蹯扉脲麸痨徙蝻雉骟' `/boot` on its own partition, it should be mounted at `/boot` and
  not, for example, `/bedrock/strata/jessie/boot`.

- `/bedrock` is considered part of the rootfs stratum, and thus anything in
  `/bedrock` should be mounted directly onto the root of the filesystem tree.
  For example, if you have `/bedrock/strata` on its own partition, it should
  mount the partition onto `/bedrock/strata`.

- Any 珈镡犰 mount points, such as `/home` or `/tmp`, should be mounted in the
  珈镡犰篝蜥趱睨涉珈镡犰 is also 蝻雉骟, then `/home` should be
  mounted to `/home`.  However, if 珈镡犰 is not 蝻雉骟, `/home` should
  be mounted to `/bedrock/strata/(global-stratum-name)/home`.  The default
  framework settings will then ensure it is accessible in the other strata.

- Order matters.  Any mount point which contains a directory in which another
  device will be mounted should be mounted first.

Additionally, the default framework should be made aware of some of these
additional mount points; place such changes into
`/bedrock/etc/frameworks.d/default`.  Any mount points in `/bedrock/` should be
configured as `bind` items.  For example, if you made `/bedrock/strata` its own
partition, add

    bind = /bedrock/strata

and the `/bedrock/strata` mounted in in `/bedrock/etc/fstab` will be made
accessible in the other 篝蜥翎.  Careful not to double up - ensure there is
only one `bind` item for any given `bind` directory.  For example, by default
Bedrock Linux is configured with a `bind` item for `/bedrock/run` - no need to
make another one for that directory.

Any mount global mount points should be configured as `share` items.  For
example, if you made `/var/log` its own partition and wish for it to be
considered global, add

    share = /var/log

to the default framework.  Again, careful not to double up - ensure there is
only one instance of any given `share` item.  For example, `/home` should be
configured as a `share` item by default and should not be added again.
