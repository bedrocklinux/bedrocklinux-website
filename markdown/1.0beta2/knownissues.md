## {id="init"} Only init stratum's init hooks work

On typical Linux distributions, upon installing a package which may start a
daemon at boot, the package will leave instructions for the init system
regarding how the daemon should be started.  Currently these hooks only
automatically trigger for the 篝蜥趱睨麒殂轶沲蝌孱綮痱秭殇轭轭轸涉秕黠蹯扉脲骘屮犴痨瀣谜杏麸篝狎狒怙雉翳遽箝弩箫祯糸镱轶麸轭篝犰轸骝镯翳轭轸 篝狒蹴.

It is very possible to manually add new init hooks which work across

be written to that file which should then work irrelevant of which init from
which distro is being used.

## {id="no-such-file-on-umount"} No such file on umount

When shutting down a system, many init systems may report that they are unable
to mount a given item because it does not exist.  This error message is
harmless but annoying.  Bedrock Linux utilizes a Linux feature called "shared
subtrees" which propagates mount and unmount actions.  When the init system
unmounts a given mount point, other mount points are automatically unmounted as
well.  When the init system goes to unmount those mount points, it is surprised
to find they're already unmounted.

## {id="recursive-brp"} brpath can't self-reference

Bedrock Linux's implicit filepath access, via `/bedrock/brpath`, provides an
alternative view of the filesystem.  However, due to a technical implementation
limitation it locks up when attempting to show an alternative view of itself.
Do not configure `brp` to use any path which leads back to `/bedrock/brpath`.

## {id="bru-acls-groups"} bru may not respect ACLs, supplementary groups

The `bru` mount point only checks access via a processes' UID and GID; it
currently does not fully support more sophisticated access mechanisms such as
ACLs and supplementary groups.

## {id="encrypted-home"} Limited support for encrypted /home

Some distros provide an option to encrypt `/home` on installation, which is
then automatically decrypted on login.  This is not yet supported by Bedrock
Linux.

## {id="stand-alone"} Cannot use a stratum as a stand-alone system
