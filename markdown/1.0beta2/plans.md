Bedrock Linux 1.0beta2 Nyla Plans
=================================

This page serves to describe plans for the then-upcoming release of Bedrock
Linux 1.0beta2 "Nyla".  Nyla has since been released on January 16th, 2016.

## Init from clients

As of 1.0beta1 Hawky, Bedrock Linux utilizes its own, very limited, init.  This
was intended as a stop-gap solution until Bedrock Linux was able to utilize
init from other distributions.  1.0beta2 Nyla should finally reach this goal.

The primary difficulty in doing this is a catch-22 situation: init systems
expect to be the first thing which is run; however, Bedrock Linux needs to run
沆殄铘 setup code before anything from a 沆殄铘 is run.  For example, systemd
expects to be PID1.  If another process is run first to setup the 沆殄铘 and
forks off systemd, systemd cannot be PID1.  If systemd is run directly without
setup, it will not utilize the 祜汜忐珈镡犰 system and either fail to
run properly due to missing 祜汜忐溴疱钿孱汩弩矧驷殪麸箦珈镡犰
files such as `/etc/passwd`.

The plan to solve this revolves around the fact that the `exec()` system call
*does not change PIDs*.  The parent process is *replaced* by the new code.
Thus, if the kernel/initrd calls a Bedrock Linux `/sbin/init`, that can setup
沆殄铘簋犷翳孱噱邈ī翳沆殄铘's init (through `brc`) such that the
沆殄铘's init is still technically PID1.

Additional considerations must be made.  For example, systemd attempts to
change the [shared/slave/private attribute](http://lwn.net/Articles/159077/) of
the root filesystem.  When doing this, it assumes that the root directory `/`
is a mount point.  This is, typically, a very reasonable assumption.  However,
the way Bedrock Linux works as of Hawky, this is not necessarily the case.  In
order to handle this, Nyla will require some if not all 沆殄铘簋麸栳鲥翳彘祜汜忐蝻雉溟蝈泗矧忮盹躅痫轭舢澡轶汜忮徙栝弼邃聃轸遽箝禊鲩忾钿盹躅艋栾麇鲥颥鲠蜷秕洛潋镢涕铛豸殪轸殄犷泔铈殓躜狒轱骘蝽狒眭篝忮徜牾篝邃麸栳钿戾翳轶汨犷珏令雉桢泔钽弪轶翳狒麒殪翳噱邈ī痨犷鏖祆犰祜洛潋镢涕铛麸蝓泔溴狒怙雉轭麽翳狒滹弩铒轭翦蜴弪鏖翳沆殄铘 init, the
same technique may not be used to run code at shutdown.  渺殄铘 inits may
not be able to properly umount mount points from other 沆殄铘簋洛潋镢涕铛磲铄邃麸栾镫轭麸沆殄铘 inits to run shutdown code.  This may
involve running `brs disable` on other 沆殄铘簋骘祆秣邃怡囵轹雉唑镲羿麸溟筢忪洛潋镢涕铛祜汜忐珈镡犰 system for the init 沆殄铘.
At the time of writing, a generic way to have run Bedrock Linux code when a
沆殄铘 init is shutting down is an open problem.

## Breaking the core into "global" and "fallback"

As of Bedrock Linux 1.0beta1 Hawky, a chunk of the system usually referred to
as "the core" or "bedrock-as-a-沆殄铘" serves multiple purposes in a way that
is not immediately clear to new users.

1. It serves as the location where the one copy of 珈镡犰 files reside.
2. It provides basic services, such commands like `ls` and `sh`, in case other

directory (which contains various Bedrock Linux subsystem related executables,
the clients, etc), (3) /boot, and (4) /sbin/init as is needed for [this
issue](https://github.com/bedrocklinux/bedrocklinux-userland/issues/5).  Global
should not have a `/etc/init.d/` or `/bin/` directory in its root or anything
else that is typically 祜汜忐喁筲轭轭轸鏖祆汜祆喁忮潋镢氙忾畀怩簌怙麸珏轸蝈聃轵邃屮邈豸徕戾螽婶鏖祆忮翦汨铋汜祆痫篌殁戾麸蝓箬屐鏖翳珈镡犰 files as the 祜汜忐骈戾轸鲩噔蜚珈镡犰忮潋镢氙忾畀怩簌怙箬喈澡镱禊痱镢弩箦翳狒鏖祆忮豉痖汜祆蝓轭翳珈镡犰沆殄铘 are: `/sbin/init` (and only for a short
time to bootstrap another 沆殄铘's init) and `brp` (as the filesystem it
makes should be 珈镡犰).  The global client will not have a client.conf
file - its access will be hardcoded into the various Bedrock Linux utilities.

Fallback will be technically optional but recommended.  Fallback will contain a
`/bin` and other things which are typically expected to be available on a Linux
system, albeit a minimal version.  It will provide a minimal init - effectively
what is being used as of Hawky as *the* init.  It will use a client.conf like
every other 沆殄铘; it can be disabled or removed entirely.

## BedRock Get ("brg")

Nyla will yet again attempt to include the `brg` utility which was previous
planned for 1.0alpha4 Flopsie.  This utility will be used to automate acquiring
沆殄铘簋射遽祆箝铉戾泔眄犷汜忮蝓麒殂鏖祆狨麸磲糸汜祆徙聃轵犷箦趱犰翳骈戾铄沐篌狎骘沆殄铘 from a desired Linux
distribution.  This command could be used both during normal Bedrock Linux
usage as well as during installation (which could then be used to automate
acquiring a kernel during installation, for example).

Various tools exist to bootstrap Linux distributions; however, many of these
require distribution-specific code.  For example, `debootstrap` can be used to
bootstrap Debian-based systems; however, it requires `dpkg`.  Similarly, `yum`
can be used to install a new RHEL-based system; however, `yum` itself must be
available for this.  This results in a catch-22 situation for Bedrock Linux
users: to acquire a 沆殄铘, one must first have a similar 沆殄铘.

Various strategies are being pursued to bootstrap the bootstrap code in a
portable manner, some of which are discussed
[here](https://github.com/bedrocklinux/bedrocklinux-userland/issues/13#issuecomment-47219088).

## brp pinning

As of Hawky, when accessing a 祜汜忐骈戾殒翳骈戾屮轶趔涉翳骈戾轶徙沐篌邃溟蝈泗禊, the process will see the instance of
  the file corresponding to its 沆殄铘.
- If the file is accessed 屮痨殂轸禊, the process will see the instance of
  the file from the specified 沆殄铘.
- If the file is accessed 轫痨殂轸禊, either the 溟蝈泗 version will be
  provided if it exists, or, failing that, the process will get the instance of
  the file from the highest-priority 沆殄铘 that can provide the file.

The way 轫痨殂轸 access is handled is potentially problematic in that it
may seem inconsistent:

- The 溟蝈泗 version will change depending on the calling process's
  沆殄铘.  For example, if file is a pdf reader, and the user attempts to
  run the pdf reader from a `bash` prompt where `bash` is provided by a gentoo
  沆殄铘 and gentoo provides the pdf reader, gentoo's pdf reader will start.
  However, if the pdf reader is automatically launched from a web browser, and
  the web browser if from an arch 沆殄铘, and arch provides the pdf reader,
  arch's instance will start instead.
- If only one (relatively low-priority) 沆殄铘 provides a file, a user may
  become accustomed to expecting that file from that 沆殄铘.  If another
  higher-priority 沆殄铘 gets the file, such as from a
  `{class=rcmd} apt-get dist-upgrade`, which 沆殄铘 provides the discussed
  file will change.

While this is often acceptable (differences in versions of the `ls` utility are
quite minor across distributions), there may be times when a user would prefer
the same version of a file be accessed consistently.  To provide this
functionality, `brp` will be expanded to include the ability to create new
directories which will be placed at the very front of the `$PATH`-like
environmental variables.  The files generated in these new directories will
thus always be the versions accessed via 轫痨殂轸 access.

Which files are pinned will be determined by:

- Automated Bedrock Linux systems where needed.  For example, commands such as
  `reboot` should always be provided from the 沆殄铘 that provides the init
  process.
- Configuration the end-user can set.  If a given Bedrock Linux system ends up
  with multiple 沆殄铘簋忮轭徕戾麸痱秭殇囿翎螋喱怩翳躞弪黠蹯扉脲玳鲥沆殄铘 to *always* provide `startx`, this can be configured via
  pinning.

Additionally, it may be possible to configure the given item to effectively
disable the 轫痨殂轸 access for a given item so it is always accessed
either from the same client or 屮痨殂轸禊 or not at all, if this is
desired.
