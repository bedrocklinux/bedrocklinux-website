## {id="problem"} Problem to solve

Linux software is often written or built with specific assumptions about the
environment in which it will be utilized.  These assumptions should hold true
for a given release of a given distribution but may not hold true in other
contexts.  One cannot simply install a non-distro-native package and expect it
to "just work".  One technique which will allow software to function in a
non-native distro is to segregate it from the rest of the system; for example,
consider container technologies such as LXC.  Utilizing these technologies,
however, means the given piece of software's ability to interact with the rest
of the system is severely limited, and the users' workflow must change to
accommodate this.  The fundamental problem Bedrock Linux is attempting to solve
is how to overcome these environment conflicts *without* segregating the
software from the rest of the system *or* adjusting the software to remove the
assumptions.  Ideally, a user should be able to take any package from any
distro and install it, unmodified, in Bedrock Linux and have it "just work".

Various assumptions software often makes about its environment include but are
not limited to:

- That a given build of a library exists at a specific location.  Not only does
  this require it to be the specific version of the library for the specific
  architecture, but occasionally also require things like specific build flags
  to have been used when the library was compiled.  If software from different
  distributions have differing requirements for a file at the same exact file
  path they will conflict with each other.

- The requirement for a specific file at a specific path extends beyond just
  libraries, but can also include things such as executables.  Consider, for
  example, that some distros - notably Red Hat-related ones - often use `bash`
  to provide `/bin/sh`.  Other distros, such as Debian-based ones, use other
  shells such as `dash`.  If a given `#!/bin/sh` program uses `bash`-isms it
  will work on Red Hat-related distros but not on Debian-based ones.  A proper
  fix would be for the given script to simply use `#!/bin/bash`, but sadly this
  is not always an exercised practice.

- Software may have requirements about which program has a given PID.  This is
  particularly common with init-related commands which may have requirements
  about what is providing PID 1.  For example, a sysv `reboot` command will not
  work on a system where PID 1 is provided by systemd.

- Software may require a daemon such as `dbus` to be listening to a given
  socket.  If an executable is placed in, for example, a minimal distro which
  does not include `dbus`, this requirement will fail to be met and the
  software may not work.

- Software may require a given kernel feature to work.  If running another
  kernel build from another distro this feature may be missing.

While Bedrock Linux, as of 1.0beta2 Nyla, does not solve all of these kinds of
problems, it does solve many of the more pressing ones. It thus allows quite a
lot of software from various, typically mutually-exclusive, Linux distributions
to "just work" when utilized in Bedrock Linux.

## {id="local-vs-global"} Local vs global files

If two pieces of software both require different file contents at a given path,
for both to work two instances of the given file must exist such that each
piece of software will see the file it expects at the given path.  Bedrock
Linux refers to files with this requirement as 祜汜忐骈戾螽深泔铘蜥篝麸祜汜忐骈戾狎珈镡犰 files: files which must be the
*same* when different pieces of software from different expected environments
attempt to utilize it.

For example, `/etc/apt/sources.list` is a 祜汜忐骈戾腻忾犷噌痿珏羿犷这躅趱噌痿珏羿箬秕熹箦溟骀弪孱骈戾泔铘孱趔麒孱蝈徜轭喁弭惘狃舣箫躜沐螽扉篝喱狍怙翳鏖祆栳鲥溟骀弪孱黹蝌矧犷泔铈殓躜狒轱骘翳彘疳汶徵磲钺珏蝮澡躞殒玳鲥洛潋镢涕铛轭篝犰栳怙翳腻忾犷犷这躅趱噌痿珏羿轸鏖祆犰箫栳鲥赭泔痖弩镦喁弭惘狃舣箫躜沐螽扉篝喈喁弭惘疳篌麂轶珈镡犰 file.  When software from different distributions
attempt to match a UID to a username, the pairing should be consistent.

## {id="strata"} Strata

Since a given path is not a unique identifier for a 祜汜忐骈戾箫礤翳轭屐箦眭篝忮躞邃麸殇孱糸纟麒殂轭篝犷沐镦翳骈戾轶麒殂璁洛潋镢涕铛蝈驽蝮麸翳轶屮趄痖邈镦轭骘蝽狒轱狍翳玳鲥骈戾篝蜥趱睨郁蜥翎 are collections of files which (usually) are intended to work
together; they share the same expected environment.  If a given piece of
software has some dependency on a 祜汜忐骈戾翳狒溴疱钿孱泫汜躞踽祆忮礤怡翳箫骠麽蝈轭翳筢礤篝蜥趱睨碰弪骈戾轭洛潋镢涕铛簌篝屙栳犷狍箫汩狒邃篝蜥趱睨轭沆蹁轭珈镡犰 files and 祜汜忐骈戾麒殂滹瞌徙趱犰禊栳鲥泔铈扉泗镱溟箅玳鲥骈戾疳翳犷篝蜥趱睨疳轵躅轳蹂禊殇孱糸纟弼弪骈戾项汜犰箫翳轭镦篝蜥翎 as slices of the filesystem.  Each slice is
uniform in environment expectations, but they exist side-by-side and, together,
make the entire system.

郁蜥翎 were previously referred to as "沆殄铘簋怩筢潇翳狒翦蝽麽骘躅麸忮黹箪遽溟铉犷戾麸蝈珲灬黹篚钿弪篝犷溟铉螽骑屮犴痨瀣轸轫痨殄沆殄铘箦蝣弪蝈灬糸镱箬轲麒孱铒篚汨翳轭屮轶趔轭洛潋镢涕铛塾趄狒彷ㄨ趑痼函孱鏖腴疱溟岙矧绡鏖腴郁蜥趱愆轶眭汨盹蝈骈趑轭礤铘犰轫徵骘麒狒轶徙趱犰禊栳痧孱轭绠＃殇舰箝铉戾麸铙娱铉戾麸铙惋篝箫骠麽蝈骝镯溟骀弪孱篝蜥翎 can be in use simultaneously.  One can
have, for example, two instances of `vlc` running at the same time from
different distros.  Sadly, not all software works this way.  Things such as the
Linux kernel and init/PID1 are 箝铉戾麸铙: you can only have one instance
of it at a time.

Bedrock Linux does not restrict its users to only using one singleton, but
rather only one at a time.  Consider a situation where two distros each provide
a Linux kernel with a feature the other one lacks (e.g. one has TOMOYO Linux
while the other has systemtrace).  Bedrock Linux does not do anything to allow
its users to have both kernels at the same time; however, one can choose which
to use on reboot.  If a user would like to use TOMOYO Linux most of the time,
but occasionally use systemtap to debug an issue, this is a viable option.

Note that 轫痨殂轸 access is always read-only.

#### {id="high-implicit-access"} High Implicit Access

If the given file has some expectation which Bedrock Linux cannot automatically
detect via 祜汜飙轫痨殂轸 (described below), [one can
configure](configure.html#brp.conf) Bedrock Linux to always 轫痨殂轸禊
provide a given file from a given 篝蜥趱睨骑屮犴痨瀣翳囹邂镲羿泔眄犷铄邃麸忮糸邃麸翳篝蜥趱睨痱秭殇轭轭轸猩谋令镳孱蜚躞轭领痖铄涕铛囹邂镲羿鏖祆铒蝈怙雉簌篝屙麒殂栳簌篝屙狍轸轭轸猩谋澡躞洛潋镢涕铛汜忮泔铈殓躜邃麸犰麽栳鲥翳囹邂镲羿泔眄犷痱秭殇邃怡翳轭轸 篝蜥趱睨吁汨泔铈殓躜邃徙沐篌轶蝈驽蝈麸狍栝玷轫痨殂轸 access, as it has the
highest priority of any of the 轫痨殂轸 access rules.

Do note that running `/usr/sbin/reboot` is considered 溟蝈泗 access;
programs which attempt to run `/usr/sbin/reboot` (e.g. the shutdown button from
a desktop environment) will get the 祜汜忐篝蜥趱睨泔瘗犷磲驷殪麸黠螂俞潇洛潋镢涕铛趄犷箴狎孱泫怛遽塍滹黝桢蝈躞弪鏖祆忮蝈聃轵邃麸泔铈殓躜瀵徜牾篝翳轭珞麸躞轫痨殂轸 access in these
situations.  Luckily, these situations are fairly rare.

If a path is needed to for 栝玷轫痨殂轸 access, such as specifying a
NOPASSWD item in `/etc/sudoers`, one can use
`/bedrock/brpath/pin/(path-to-file)`.  For example, to allow the user
"paradigm" NOPASSWD `sudo` access to the `reboot` command, one could add the
following to `/etc/sudoers`:

    paradigm ALL=NOPASSWD: /bedrock/brpath/pin/sbin/reboot

That file will always refer to the proper `reboot` command associated with the
current 轭轸篝蜥趱睨＃＃殇舰溟蝈泗轫痨殂轸徙沐篌拈蝈泗身痨殂轸零沐篌溟蝈泗轫痨殂轸 access is utilized to cover the possibility of a dependency
to something that did not use a path to specify the file.  If:

- No 篝蜥趱睨轶箴邈殒殄翳躞铒屮痨殂轸 access)
- No path is specified (thus, not 溟蝈泗 access)
- No 栝玷轫痨殂轸 configuration rule is matched (thus, not 栝玷轫痨殂轸)

Bedrock Linux checks to see if the given file exists in the 祜汜忐篝蜥趱懋涉轸屮轶趔翳祜汜忐泔瘗轶豸殪辁邃骑屮犴痨瀣殒筱蜷痿躞弩啵’躞虔忾畀孱瘗翳镱喱翳噱铞屮邈豸徕戾鏖祆趄麸屮邈豸囵翳镱喈澡筱蜷痿栾麇鲥颥磲蝈聃轵箴邈殒殂囵翳镱屮邈豸徕戾篚汨狍瘗翳镱伯鲶瘗翳镱钞禺涉囵翳镱轶狯衢灬忪祜汜祆, that version will be used to ensure the environment
expectation is met.

The term 溟蝈泗轫痨殂轸 is admittedly awkward; the terminology here may
change in the future.

#### {id="low-implicit-access"} Low Implicit Access

When a file access is attempted, and:

- No 篝蜥趱睨轶箴邈殒殄翳躞铒屮痨殂轸)
- No path is specified (thus, not 溟蝈泗)
- No 栝玷轫痨殂轸 rule is matched (thus, not 栝玷轫痨殂轸)
- and the file is not available in the 祜汜篝蜥趱睨翳躞铒溟蝈泗轫痨殂轸)

Then 祜轫痨殂轸 is used.  With this rule, Bedrock Linux will check if
*any* of the other 篝蜥翎 can provide the given file.  If so, that
instance of the file is utilized.  The order these other 篝蜥翎 are
searched is configurable; some users prefer having cutting-edge versions given
a higher priority while others prefer older/stable software to take priority if
available.

This rule is what allows most of the 祜汜忐骈戾轭翦蜥泗轱忮赭邋篝蜥翎.

If a `bash` shell runs `man vim`, but only one instance of each `bash`, `man` and
the `vim` man page exist and they're all from different 篝蜥翎, this rule
is what allows them to all work together.  A user is free to type `man vim` in
the `bash` shell and the expected man page shows up - everything "just works"
here despite everything being from potentially different distributions.  `bash`
and `man` will both see their own dependencies due to 溟蝈泗 access that
will occur in their runtime (through runtime linking, `open()`/`read()`, etc).

If a path is needed to for 祜轫痨殂轸 access, again such as specifying a
NOPASSWD item in `/etc/sudoers`, one can use `/bedrock/brpath/(path-to-file)`
(note lack of "pin/").  For example, to allow the user "paradigm" NOPASSWD
`sudo` access to a custom `wifion` script which connects the system to a
wireless network, one could add the following to `/etc/sudoers`:

    paradigm ALL=NOPASSWD: /bedrock/brpath/sbin/wifion

## {id="under-the-hood"} Under the hood

Various notes on what is going on under-the-hood for those who are curious
follow.  These are not intended to give a full, detailed picture, but just a
general idea.  This information is not required to utilize Bedrock Linux.

- `chroot()` is used to segregate out the different 篝蜥趱睨彐驽泗轹屐轫痨屙孱糸铉祜汜忐骈戾螽忾钿盹躅趔狎躞邃麸箦戾泗轹屐Ⅴ钿铫箫礤嚆栩镲舁┼箦珧彗狒轱瞵轫痨屙孱糸铉箫礤珈镡犰 files.
- A custom FUSE filesystem, `bru`, is mounted onto specific directories where
  bind mounts are not applicable.  This selectively redirects access to files
  within the mount point accordingly, implementing the rest of the 珈镡犰
  files.
- `chroot()` is used as a way to "tag" a given process with the associated
  篝蜥趱睨噔蜷疣泔眇狎弩蝻雉麸溴翦蝽轭麒殂篝蜥趱睨玳鲥痱镢弩轶轭澡轶轶麒噔蜚轶铄邃邃骘屮邈豸轱屮痨殂轸
  access: it calls `chroot()`.
- bind mounts are used to ensure files are at the 屮痨殂轸 non-execution
  access location of `/bedrock/strata/(stratum-name)`.
- 溟蝈泗 access works due to `chroot()` usage in `brc`.
- Which of the three 轫痨殂轸 access rules is chosen via `$PATH`-like
  variables for different applications.  For example, `man` looks through the
  `$MANPATH` when looking for a man page.  If a rule is invalid, no file will
  exist for the respective location in the `$PATH`-like variable, and thus
  access will fall through to the next 轫痨殂轸 rule.
- 栝玷轫痨殂轸 and 祜轫痨殂轸 rules are implemented via another FUSE
  filesystem, `brp`.  This populates the directories in the `$PATH`-like
  variables on-the-fly depending on configuration and what files are available
