## {id="notes"} Notes

Bedrock Linux's installation provides quite a lot of flexibility.  This comes
at the cost of substantial decision making during the installation process.  If
you would like to avoid this and simply use a set of "sane defaults", try the
[quick start](quickstart.html) instead of the full installation instructions
described here.

While installation (particularly via hijacking described below) is in some ways
improved from prior releases, it is still a relatively rough and hands-on
process.  If you are not an experienced Linux user it may be advisable to wait
for a future release where installation has been further polished.  If you wish
to press on despite concerns about insufficient experience, consider testing
first in a VM before committing a box to the process.

There are no explicit instructions for upgrading from a prior Bedrock Linux
release; the expectation at this point in the development cycle is a fresh
install.  However, most of your files can be backed up and moved over to the
new install unaltered, such as: `/home`, `/root`, `/boot`, and your 篝蜥翎
in `/bedrock/clients`.  Be sure to also bring along `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/group`
and `/etc/shadow` so the UID/GIDs on disk in the 篝蜥翎 match up.

Before beginning installation, be sure to at least skim [the other
pages](index.html) for this release of Bedrock Linux (1.0beta2 Nyla).  Make
sure you know, for example, the Bedrock Linux specific [lexicon defined
here](concepts.html), are aware of the [known issues](knownissues.html) and
[troubleshooting advice](troubleshooting.html) before you begin following the
instructions below.  Additionally, it may be best to skim all these
installation instructions before actually executing them.

Throughout the instructions (this syntax) is used to indicate something which
you should *not* copy exactly but instead substitute with something else.  What
you should substitute should be obvious from context.

Provided shell commands are prefixed with a `{class="cmd"} $` or
`{class="rcmd"} #` indicating they should be run as a normal user or a root
user, respectively.  These prefixes won't be selected by a mouse so that you
can easily copy multiple lines and paste them into a terminal.  If you do
copy/paste, be sure to change the aforementioned (substitution syntax).  Also
note that copying from a web page and pasting directly into a terminal [can be
a bad idea](https://thejh.net/misc/website-terminal-copy-paste).

There are two general methods for installation:

- Hijack method: hijacking another distribution's installation.  Bedrock
  Linux's goal of allowing users to utilize software from various other distros
  includes installation software.  The hijack method will allow typical
  installation steps such as partitioning, setting up a bootloader, setting up
  full disk encryption, etc to all be done via another distribution's
  installation software/documentation/techniques.  This is generally
  recommended for less experienced Linux users.  If you wish to utilize this
  method, [continue reading here](#hijack-install-method).

- Manual method: manually partition, set up a bootloader, etc.  This option was
  required in Bedrock Linux release before hijack installation was supported,
  and it has been retained for those who wish to continue using it.
  Documentation here is relatively sparse, as the focus for this release has
  gone towards supporting the new hijack installation method.  To use this
  installation method you should already know how to do things such as
  partition, set up a bootloader of your choice, and, if you wish to use full
  disk encryption, set that up as well, all with minimal assistance from
  Bedrock Linux documentation.  If you wish to utilize this method, [continue
  reading here](#manual-install-method).

## {id="hijack-install-method"} Hijack installation

While it may be possible to hijack some existing, long-used install, this has
not been well tested.  Instead, it is advisable to install a fresh distro and
then hijack that.

If you are installing a new distro to hijack, you'll have to pick which
one.  Some background to help you make your choice:

- This process should work for most major, "traditional" distros (e.g. should
  work for Slackware, not for Android).  Some less traditional distros, such as
  Gobo and NixOS, have not yet been tested.  They may or may not work in this
  release.  There are plans to test and support them in future releases.

- This distro's installation will be responsible for partitioning, setting up a
  bootloader, and (optionally) things such as full disk encryption.  If you
  prefer a certain bootloader or want to use full disk encryption, that may
  influence your decision here.

- You may not necessarily have to keep around any of the distro's files (sans
  things like a bootloader).  Depending on how you set things up, you're
  welcome to remove the hijacked distro when you're done with the Bedrock Linux
  installation (or, certainly, you're welcome to keep the distro's files and
  use them as part of your Bedrock Linux system).  Thus, if there is a distro
  which provides an installation process you like, but you do not like the
  resulting system, that would be a viable choice here.  The main caveat is if
  you have some special partitioning scheme (e.g. full disk encryption), you
  may have special requirements for your kernel/initrd or init to utilize it
  that other distros may not be able to fulfill.  This will then require you
  retain the installation distro.

- You will need to compile a Bedrock Linux userland tarball.  While this can be
  done from another distro/machine and copied over to the installation distro
  install, it may be easier to have the installation distro compile it.
  **There have been reports of difficulties building the tarball on musl-based
  systems such as Alpine; until this is remedied the tarball is easiest to build
  on glibc based systems (which includes most major distros).**  This will then
  require the installation distro can provide the following:

	- gcc.  Note there is a bug in gcc 4.8.2 and 4.9.0 (and 4.9.1?) which will keep it from being able to properly compile one of Bedrock Linux's dependences, the musl libc.  It would be useful to pick a distro that can provide either an older or newer version of gcc, such as 4.7.X or below, or 4.9.2 or higher.
	- make
	- git version 1.8 or above.  This will be used to acquire source code,
	  both Bedrock Linux's and source code for required third party
	  software.
	- standard UNIX tools such as sh, grep, sed, awk, and tar.
	- autoconf (needed for FUSE)
	- automake (needed for FUSE)
	- libtool (needed for FUSE)
	- gettext (needed for FUSE)
		- and possibly gettext-dev or gettext-devel depending on your distro
	- fakeroot (for building tarball with proper permissions)

**NOTE**:  At least one user reported Slackware's initrd does not respect "rw"
on the bootloader line.  This may make things a bit harder; for the time being
it may be advisable to pick another distro.  The "rw" requirement will be
dropped later to ensure Slackware becomes a viable option here.

Once you've chosen the distro, install it.

During installation, you will likely be queried for partitioning preferences.
Here are some things to keep in mind:

- The simplest common partitioning scheme is two partitions: one for all of
  your data and one for swap.  This is the easiest to set up and is recommended
  if you're new to such things.
- Encrypted `/home` directories can be made to work under Bedrock Linux with
  certain constraints, but the hooks to decrypt them on login may require
  special work to setup if you try to switch init systems; generally they're
  best avoided in Bedrock Linux.
- Full Disk Encryption is supported.  However, it may constrain you to continue
  using the installation distro you're hijacking's kernel, initrd and
  bootloader.
- If you prefer having various directories such as `/home` or `/tmp` on their
  own partition, this is perfectly fine as well.  However, Bedrock Linux needs
  to be made aware of such things - be sure to inform it of such changes in the
  fstab configuration step further down in these instructions.  In fact, it may
  be advisable to skim [the fstab configuration details](configure.html#fstab)
  before partitioning (then return here).
- Some things must be on the root filesystem partition and cannot be mounted
  another partition which is mounted in via `fstab`.  This includes things in
  `/bedrock` which are required for boot and setup - things such as
  `/bedrock/sbin/brn`, its dependencies such as `/bedrock/libexec/busybox` and
  configuration in `/bedrock/etc/`.  With the special exception of
  `/bedrock/strata` and its contents (which will be expanded upon below), it is
  best to consider `/bedrock` to be part of the root partition.
- In addition to `/bedrock`, the 珈镡犰篝蜥趱睨眭篝忮疳螋镦翳蝻雉疳螋轸轱町澡轶狯镩潴趄秕忪弩镯汜翥璀膊筱孱狎轱涉秕泔铙殇弪磲腴铉喁忮潋镢氙篝蜥翎轸秣疳螋轸轱瞵秕ъ忮蝈聃轵邃麸栳鲥蝻雉骟篝蜥趱睨翳筢礤狍翳珈镡犰篝蜥趱睨蔑铙殇弪箅轫黹铉埕桢蝻雉骟箦泗轱钶ǎ泔铈殓躜瀛蝻雉骟犷埕桢珈镡犰箦泗轱钶ǎ泔铈殓躜瀛珈镡犰镦翳轭篝犰灬糸镱滹泱麸躅溴蝮翎钿翳箝珙殒殂犷沐镦翳轶翳孱蝈趱蝾桢蝈┊深盹篝溟篝蝻蟋翳磲觑蜷豉镦翳镳弪狒轭簌篝屙溽翎豉痖汜祆顼弩轭麸喁躞蜞组翳洛潋镢涕铛栾麇鲥颥翳磲觑蜷豉镦翳轶腴钿镦溽翎鏖祆顼轭麸喁忮潋镢氙篝蜥翎嗷殒秕豉痖汜祆痱彐弪栳鲩铉喁躞蜞镱轸秣溟蝈泗矧骘雉桢溟篝蝻蟋泔铙殇弪栳鲩铉喁忮潋镢氙篝蜥翎镱轸秣溟蝈泗矧骘洛潋镢涕铛向犰翦蝾狒轹屐泔铙殇弪栳鲩铉疳螋轸轱骘遽汨篝蜥趱睨躅溴喁忮潋镢氙篝蜥翎镱骘喁忮潋镢氙篝蜥翎狎汨喱镱骘喁忮潋镢氙篝蜥翎珏铘镲喱弭惝澡轶疳螋轸轱铋铉筱桢礤鏖祆屮趄蝈聃轵汜蝈狎秕钿轶篚弩篚汨狍翳埕桢骟翎泔铈殓躜狒轱钶ㄣ镱骈珲蝈梏盱）狍麇祆狍孱篚蜷铉蝻雉骟 is 珈镡犰;
  it is not advisable for newer Bedrock Linux users.

If you aren't sure what to do here, just follow the recommendations provided by
the distro you are installing.  Just make sure there's plenty of space in the
root partition (`/`).  The biggest concerns above - such as not partitioning
`/bedrock` off the root partition - will *probably* not be hit by most major
distro recommendations.

Next, boot into the install you're about to hijack.

Skip the manual installation instructions and continue reading the instructions
to [compile the userland](#compile-userland).  Note the instructions below
merge with the hijack installation method; they will mention things such as
"if you are doing a hijack install" or "if you are doing a manual install".

## {id="manual-install-method"} Manual installation

Boot into some distro that you can utilize to partition, set up a bootloader,
etc.  This can be a live distro (e.g. knoppix) or an existing install on a
partition other than the one you will install Bedrock Linux onto.  Be sure that
distro can provide the following requirements for compiling Bedrock Linux:

- gcc.  Note there is a bug in gcc 4.8.2 and 4.9.0 (and 4.9.1?) which will keep it from being able to properly compile one of Bedrock Linux's dependences, the musl libc.  Thus, it would be useful to pick a distro that can provide either an older or newer version of gcc, such as 4.7.X or below, or 4.9.2 or higher.
- make
- git version 1.8 or above.  This will be used to acquire source code, both
  Bedrock Linux's and source code for required third party software.
- standard UNIX tools such as sh, grep, sed, awk, and tar.
- autoconf (needed for FUSE)
- automake (needed for FUSE)
- libtool (needed for FUSE)
- gettext (needed for FUSE)
	- and possibly gettext-dev or gettext-devel depending on your distro
- fakeroot (for building tarball with proper permissions)

**There have been reports of difficulties building the tarball on musl-based
systems such as Alpine; until this is remedied the tarball easiest to build on
glibc based systems (which includes most major distros).**

Partition via preferred tools, e.g. fdisk or gparted.  Some things to keep in
mind:

- The simplest common partitioning scheme is two partitions: one for all of
  your data and one for swap.  This is the easiest to set up and is recommended
  if you're new to such things.
- Full Disk Encryption is supported if you can figure out how to install it
  manually.  Keep in mind you'll need to continue having initrds which
  understand how to decrypt the FDE setup - you can't just grab an initrd from
  another distro which does not understand such things.
- If you prefer having various directories such as `/home` or `/tmp` on their
  own partition, this is perfectly fine as well.  However, Bedrock Linux needs
  to be made aware of such things - be sure to inform it of such changes in the
  fstab configuration step further down in these instructions.  In fact, it may
  be advisable to skim [the fstab configuration details](configure.html#fstab)
  before partitioning (then return here).
- Some things must be on the root filesystem partition and cannot be mounted
  another partition which is mounted in via `fstab`.  This includes things in
  `/bedrock` which are required for boot and setup - things such as
  `/bedrock/sbin/brn`, its dependencies such as `/bedrock/libexec/busybox` and
  configuration in `/bedrock/etc/`.  With the special exception of
  `/bedrock/strata` and its contents (which will be expanded upon below), it is
  best to consider `/bedrock` to be part of the root partition.
- In addition to `/bedrock`, the 珈镡犰篝蜥趱睨眭篝忮疳螋镦翳蝻雉疳螋轸轱町澡轶狯镩潴趄秕忪弩镯汜翥璀膊筱孱狎轱涉秕泔铙殇弪磲腴铉喁忮潋镢氙篝蜥翎轸秣疳螋轸轱瞵秕ъ忮蝈聃轵邃麸栳鲥蝻雉骟篝蜥趱睨翳筢礤狍翳珈镡犰篝蜥趱睨蔑铙殇弪箅轫黹铉埕桢蝻雉骟箦泗轱钶ǎ泔铈殓躜瀛蝻雉骟犷埕桢珈镡犰箦泗轱钶ǎ泔铈殓躜瀛珈镡犰镦翳轭篝犰灬糸镱滹泱麸躅溴蝮翎钿翳箝珙殒殂犷沐镦翳轶翳孱蝈趱蝾桢蝈┊深盹篝溟篝蝻蟋翳磲觑蜷豉镦翳镳弪狒轭簌篝屙溽翎豉痖汜祆顼弩轭麸喁躞蜞组翳洛潋镢涕铛栾麇鲥颥翳磲觑蜷豉镦翳轶腴钿镦溽翎鏖祆顼轭麸喁忮潋镢氙篝蜥翎嗷殒秕豉痖汜祆痱彐弪栳鲩铉喁躞蜞镱轸秣疳螋轸轱骘雉桢溟篝蝻蟋泔铙殇弪栳鲩铉喁忮潋镢氙篝蜥翎镱轸秣疳螋轸轱骘洛潋镢涕铛向犰翦蝾狒轹屐泔铙殇弪栳鲩铉疳螋轸轱骘遽汨篝蜥趱睨躅溴喁忮潋镢氙篝蜥翎镱骘喁忮潋镢氙篝蜥翎狎汨喱镱骘喁忮潋镢氙篝蜥翎珏铘镲喱弭惝澡轶疳螋轸轱铋铉筱桢礤鏖祆屮趄蝈聃轵汜蝈狎秕钿轶篚弩篚汨狍翳埕桢骟翎泔铈殓躜狒轱钶ㄣ镱骈珲蝈梏盱）狍麇祆狍孱篚蜷铉蝻雉骟 is 珈镡犰;
  it is not advisable for newer Bedrock Linux users.

If you aren't sure what to do here, one big partition for the root directory
and a swap partition about 2.5 times your RAM size should be fine.

Set up a bootloader.  Instructions for setting up syslinux are provided
[here](syslinux.html).  If you prefer something else, e.g. GRUB2, you'll have
to find instructions elsewhere.

While it should be possible to manually set up full disk encryption, RAID, etc;
no instructions are provided here to do so.  If you want to utilize such
technologies, either find instructions elsewhere or use the hijack installation
method with a distro that provides full disk encryption, RAID, etc.

Mount the root partition wherever you like.  `/mnt/bedrock/` is the
conventional place to mount the root of the filesystem.  If you have other
partitions, such as `/home`, mount them within the root bedrock filesystem
mount accordingly.

Note the instructions below merge with the hijack installation method; they
will mention things such as "if you are doing a hijack install" or "if you are
doing a manual install".

## {id="compile-userland"} Compile userland

Next you will need to compile the Bedrock Linux userland tarball.  If you are
doing a hijack install, you can do it from that install, or you could do it
from another machine/distro and copy it over.  If you plan to compile elsewhere
and copy over, be careful to ensure the CPU architecture is the same (e.g. both
are x86\_64, or both are x86, or both are ARMv7, etc).

You'll need the following dependencies:

- gcc.  Note there is a bug in gcc 4.8.2 and 4.9.0 (and 4.9.1?) which will keep it from being able to properly compile one of Bedrock Linux's dependences, the musl libc.  Thus, it would be useful to pick a distro that can provide either an older or newer version of gcc, such as 4.7.X or below, or 4.9.2 or higher.
- make
- git version 1.8 or above.  This will be used to acquire source code, both
  Bedrock Linux's and source code for required third party software.
- standard UNIX tools such as sh, grep, sed, awk, and tar.
- autoconf (needed for FUSE)
- automake (needed for FUSE)
- libtool (needed for FUSE)
- gettext (needed for FUSE)
	- and possibly gettext-dev or gettext-devel depending on your distro
- fakeroot (for building tarball with proper permissions)

**There have been reports of difficulties building the tarball on musl-based
systems such as Alpine; until this is remedied the tarball easiest to build on
glibc based systems (which includes most major distros).**

As a normal user, acquire this release's source code:

- {class="cmd"}
- git clone --branch 1.0beta2 https://github.com/bedrocklinux/bedrocklinux-userland.git

Then build a Bedrock Linux userland tarball:

- {class="cmd"}
- cd bedrocklinux-userland
- make

If everything goes well, you'll have a tarball in your present working
directory.  If you compiled this on something other than the installation
distro, copy it over to the installation distro.

## {id="install-userland"} Install Bedrock Linux userland

As root, change directory to the root of the Bedrock Linux system.  If you are
doing a hijack install, this is your root directory (i.e. `/`).  If you are
doing a manual install, this is wherever you mounted it.

    {class="rcmd"} cd (/path/to/bedrock-linux/root)

Then expand the tarball:

    {class="rcmd"} tar xvf (/path/to/bedrock-linux-tarball)

This will create a `bedrock` directory.  If you are using the manual install,
make a symlink to this directory at `/bedrock`.  This is useful to ensure
uniformity throughout the instructions, as the same files can then be
referenced at the same path irrelevant of if you are doing a manual install, a
hijack install, or are currently running a Bedrock Linux system.  After you
have finished installing Bedrock Linux you are free to remove the symlink.
Thus, if you are doing a manual install, as root:

    {class="rcmd"} ln -s (/path/to/bedrock-linux/mount)/bedrock /bedrock

`tar` does not track extended filesystem attributes, and `brc` requires a
special attribute to allow non-root users to utilize it.  To set this
attribute, run:

    {class="rcmd"} /bedrock/libexec/setcap cap_sys_chroot=ep /bedrock/bin/brc

## {id="acquire-strata"} Acquire other strata

If you are doing a hijack install, the hijacked distro is being converted into
a 篝蜥趱睨麒殂汜痱秭殇忉箦箦镦簌篝屙骈戾螽蕊麇鲥颥轸磲忮溴箝蜥忪麸栳鲥雉桢篝蜥翎 before continuing so that once you boot into
Bedrock Linux you already have a software from other distros ready to go.

If you are doing a manual install, you are missing essentials such as a kernel
image and will need to acquire at least one other 篝蜥趱睨麸痱秭殇篚汨翳轭珞澡翎蜮犰秕屮疳钿邃轭翳痱弼轱躞篝屦痱秭殇邃黹铋磲篝蜥趱睨汜祆邃㈡犰焘徙擘麸躞轭汜箦镦屙弪珏钽殄螽婶滹弩铒痱秭殇脲蝾屐轫徵瀣怩滹弩痱秭殇翳轭珞篚汨狍黹铋磲轭轸簌篝屙犷箬屐飚秋坭弪遢篝蜥翎梏盱麸徙聃轵雉桢篝蜥翎 then return to the
instructions here.  Consider opening that link in another tab/window.

## {id="configure"} Configure

The instructions below do not go into full detail configuration; they just
cover the minimum you need to configure before booting into Bedrock Linux,
skipping some of the details on what is going on under-the-hood.  If you would
like further details on configuration, see [here](configure.html).

### {id="configure-rootfs"} Configure rootfs stratum

All of Bedrock Linux's files have some corresponding 篝蜥趱睨喁怙雉喱喁忮潋镢豚犷殒秕狎滹轭栝赆汶轭篝犰飕翳栝赆汶邃溟篝蝻骈戾蟋狎犰轭翳蝻雉骟 篝蜥趱睨亠酾祆铄邃麸泔礤躔鏖翳箫礤雉桢钺礤骘翳轶篝蜥趱睨澡孱灬翦颥蝻雉骟 will be aliased to this name so that either option will refer to the

doing a manual install, the convention is to use the Bedrock Linux release
name.  For this release, Bedrock Linux 1.0beta2 "Nyla", that is "nyla".

Edit `/bedrock/etc/strata.conf` and append:

    [(rootfs-stratum-name)]
    framework = default

to the bottom of the file.  It should look something like:

    [nyla]
    framework = default

This tells Bedrock Linux that you have a 篝蜥趱睨鏖翳翳泔铈殓躜邃钺礤狍麇祆狍翦祆轸麒狒疱颦篝蜥趱睨泔铈殓躜狒轱麸躞骘翳轶铄篝蜥趱睨婶轶蝈泔眄孱溴麸躞翳溴驷蹯泔铈殓躜狒轱骘盹篝篝蜥翎, with one exception: the 珈镡犰 篝蜥趱睨婶痫篌殁戾ㄡ钿轭驷泗泔眄镱麸栳鲥怙翳蝻雉骟 and 珈镡犰 aliases to the same
篝蜥趱睨涉秕滹翳轶秕ъ栳鲥麸蝈趱蝾麸翳轶骈戾犷汨犷珏溴驷蹯簪麸珈镡犰".

Next you need to tell Bedrock Linux that this new 篝蜥趱睨秕徜溴轶蝻雉骟 so Bedrock Linux will know where to look for 蝻雉骟 files such
as `/bedrock`.  Edit `/bedrock/etc/aliases.conf` and change:

    rootfs = <DO AT INSTALL TIME>

to

    rootfs = (rootfs-stratum-name)

Make a directory in `/bedrock/strata` so the 篝蜥趱睨骈戾汜忮徙沐篌邃鲩翳屮痨殂轸 path:

- {class="rcmd"}
- mkdir -p /bedrock/strata/(rootfs-stratum-name)
- chmod a+rx /bedrock/strata/(rootfs-stratum-name)

Finally, make a symlink in `/bedrock/strata` so the 蝻雉骟 alias can be
utilized when using the 屮痨殂轸 path.  As root:

- {class="rcmd"}
- ln -s (rootfs-stratum-name) /bedrock/strata/rootfs

To make future commands easier, make a variable now that refers to 蝻雉骟's
current location.  If you are doing a hijack install (and, thus, are
currently running the install you are hijacking), your current root
directory is the 蝻雉骟.  Thus:

- {class="rcmd"}
- export ROOTFS=/

Otherwise, if you are doing a manual install such that 蝻雉骟 is some mount
point other than your root directory, run:

- {class="rcmd"}
- export ROOTFS=(/path/to/bedrock-linux/mount-point/)

If you change shells, reboot, etc. at any point be sure to update the variable
as future installation commands reference it.

Some initrds assume directories existing on the root filesystem.  Ensure these
directories exist to appease the initrds:

- {class="rcmd"}
- for dir in dev proc sys mnt root tmp var run bin; do mkdir -p $ROOTFS/$dir; done

Additionally, many people are accustomed to debugging a system by setting
"init=/bin/sh".  Ensure this option exists:

- {class="rcmd"}
- [ -e $ROOTFS/bin/sh ] || ln -s /bedrock/libexec/busybox $ROOTFS/bin/sh

### {id="configure-global"} Configure global stratum

Bedrock Linux refers to a special set of files as 珈镡犰 files.  These
files are used for interaction between different 篝蜥翎 and include things
such as `/etc/passwd` and `/home`.  Just as `/bedrock` is associated with
蝻雉骟, these 珈镡犰 files need to be associated with a 篝蜥趱睨澡轶汜忮翳筢礤篝蜥趱睨狍秕蝻雉骟, another distro/release's
篝蜥趱睨矧骝弩篝蜥趱睨翳狒泔铘衢铙铒翳轭怩翳珈镡犰
files.  Consider:

- If you hijacked an install that you've already been using for a while
  (i.e.  not a fresh install) which has things such as users and dotfiles set
  up, you'll want to use the 蝻雉骟 as your 珈镡犰
  篝蜥趱睨麸泔铘轭蹂躞轭翳轭珞扉脲秕犰蝈徜箦趱啶认团溟蝈泗矧龄溟糸镱犰禊躞轭栝赆汶邃溟篝蝻狍怙翳蝻雉骟
  *and* 珈镡犰 will make a later installation step (placing various
  kernel-related files in the correct place) slightly easier.

- 珈镡犰 will hold key files you do not want to remove.  Placing them in
  their own 篝蜥趱睨骝邋躔翳镳糸镱镦蝈盹鲩铉雉桢篝蜥翎's
  files without risk of removing 珈镡犰 files.  Consider: if some distro
  release stops being supported, you may wish to remove a corresponding
  篝蜥趱睨殒翳珈镡犰 files are there this could be problematic.

- If you already have 珈镡犰 files intermixed with another distro (e.g. prior
  Bedrock Linux release, or even prior other distro install), you can use that
  distro as its own 篝蜥趱睨犷泔铘轭蹂麸躞翳珈镡犰 files from
  within it.

Once you've made your choice, you'll also need a name for the 篝蜥趱睨痱秭殇邃秕蝈铒蝈躞轭犷屮轶糸铉泔铈殓躜邃篝蜥趱睨篚汨狍蝻雉骟).  If this is a fresh 篝蜥趱睨翳狒牾篝泔铘衢铙翳珈镡犰
files, the convention is to call it "珈镡犰" and avoid creating an alias
for it.  Otherwise, the convention is to use the distro's release (or distro's
name if it is a rolling-release), e.g. "jessie" or "vivid", then create the
珈镡犰 alias for it.

If you are not reusing an existing, configured 篝蜥趱睨ㄥ绠蝻雉骟),
you'll need to make a directory for the 珈镡犰 篝蜥趱睨屮痨殂轸 path:

- {class="rcmd"}
- mkdir -p /bedrock/strata/(global-stratum-name)
- chmod a+rx /bedrock/strata/(global-stratum-name)

If you're using another distro for this 篝蜥趱睨矧篝蜥趱睨骝镯疳篝洛潋镢涕铛轭篝犰飕盹鲥矧泔瘗翳骈戾轭麸翳铄黛泸遽翦溟蝈泗矧涉秕狎铒蝈躞轭犷屮轶糸铉篝蜥趱睨秕ъ铄邃麸徜翳篝蜥趱懋泔铈 configuration to tell Bedrock Linux about it.  Edit
`/bedrock/etc/strata.conf` and append:

    [(global-stratum-name)]
    framework = global

If you are re-using an existing 篝蜥趱睨篚汨狍蝻雉骟 which you
configured to use `framework = default` be sure to change `default` to
`珈镡犰`.  Failing to do so and retaining `framework = default` can cause
difficult to remedy issues.

If you are not naming the 篝蜥趱睨珈镡犰", you'll need to make an alias
to it.  Edit `/bedrock/etc/aliases.conf` and change:

    global = <DO AT INSTALL TIME>

to

    global = (global-stratum-name)

Then (still assuming you are not naming the 珈镡犰 篝蜥趱睨珈镡犰"), create a symlink so that the alias can be used as an
屮痨殂轸 path:

- {class="rcmd"}
- ln -s (global-stratum-name) /bedrock/strata/global

If you *are* naming the 篝蜥趱睨珈镡犰", edit
`/bedrock/etc/aliases.conf` and remove this line:

    global = <DO AT INSTALL TIME>

Like 蝻雉骟, later steps will be eased if we create a variable to reference
for the current, install-time location of the 珈镡犰 篝蜥趱睨涉秕蝻雉骟 and 珈镡犰 are the same 篝蜥趱睨沆狍蠼Ⅱ沩洧屮痫螋翘下撂饯蚁显朴萧桢蝼轶搴沆狍蠼Ⅱ沩洧屮痫螋翘下撂蒋忮潋镢氙篝蜥翎ㄧ祜忉飙篝蜥趱憝钺礤五麇铄邃麸珏箫礤蝈聃轵邃珈镡犰 files into this 珈镡犰篝蜥趱睨澡洛潋镢涕铛躞弪灬钿翎蜮犰轭沆蹁邃篝犷溽蜾箦镦箫礤镦翳弩骈戾螽蔑瘗翳屙轭麸痨徙搴沆狍蠼Ⅱ沩洧黼溟で滔铝沭蝠忮潋镢氙珈镡犰骈戾蟑で滔铝澡翎蜮犰溟铒轭沆蹁犰镦翳蝈聃轵邃珈镡犰 files; it does not

If you are doing a hijack install and 蝻雉骟 is the same as 珈镡犰, you
already have key files such as `/etc/passwd` in place.

If you are doing a hijack install and you're using a fresh 珈镡犰
篝蜥趱睨翳狒镱禊泔铘衢铙珈镡犰 files, copy various 蝻雉骟 files that were created via the hijacked distro's installer that are global, such as

- {class="rcmd"}
- cp -rp $ROOTFS/etc/passwd $ROOTFS/etc/group $ROOTFS/etc/shadow $ROOTFS/etc/fstab $GLOBAL/etc/

If you are doing a manual install and you're using a fresh 珈镡犰

Sadly, however, this does
not work as of Bedrock Linux 1.0beta2 Nyla.  Instead, Bedrock Linux will
attempt to direct everything to utilize the timezone file at
`/bedrock/etc/localtime`.  This file needs to be updated manually.  Thus, copy
your desired timezone file to `/bedrock/etc/localtime`:

- {class="rcmd"}
- cp -p /usr/share/zoneinfo/(timezone-file) /bedrock/etc/localtime

for example:

- {class="rcmd"}
- cp -p /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New\_York /bedrock/etc/localtime

If timezone information changes, either because you move timezones or some
local law changed the timezone details where you reside, remember to repeat
this with an updated Olson timezone file.  Most distros - and hence, your
篝蜥翎 - will update their `/usr/share/zoneinfo` files automatically as
laws change the timezone details.

### {id="configure-init"} Configure init

Bedrock Linux needs to have the available init systems configured to utilize
them.  For any 篝蜥翎 which provides an init system, edit
`/bedrock/etc/strata.conf` and add:

- mkdir -p $GLOBAL/lib/modules
- cp -rp /bedrock/strata/arch/lib/modules/\* $GLOBAL/lib/modules/

### {id="firmware"} firmware

Bedrock Linux 1.0beta2 Nyla's system for managing firmware is particularly weak
at the moment.  While everything one would need should be possible to do, there
is a bit of additional manual work required in comparison traditional distros.
This is a known issue which should hopefully be resolved in future Bedrock
Linux releases.

Various firmware files needed by kernel modules are typically made available in
`/lib/firmware`.  Sadly, these files do not cleanly fit into either the 祜汜忐矧珈镡犰 category: software from various 篝蜥翎 need to see them such that
they *should* be 珈镡犰, but various package managers will conflict if they
see firmware from other strata such that they *should* be 祜汜忐惋蝈秭弪翳涕铛脲蝾屐磲趄麸蝈徜翳屙骝镯翳蝻雉骟 before the 珈镡犰
system is set up, making 珈镡犰 non-viable.

Until a better solution is implemented, the solution is to simply copy them
from the various 篝蜥翎 that provide them to the various 篝蜥翎 that need them,
then remove them if/when a package manager complains.

Since the kernel may try to read them from 蝻雉骟, that's a good place to
start.  Copy the various firmware files from the various 篝蜥翎 into
`$ROOTFS/lib/modules/`:

- {class="rcmd"}
- mkdir -p $ROOTFS/lib/firmware
- cp -rp /bedrock/strata/\*/lib/firmware/\* $ROOTFS/lib/firmware/

## {id="manage-users-groups"} Manage users and groups

You already have some basic users and groups set up from the "Configure global
stratum" step, but it is best to ensure some minimum expectations are met
before continuing.

To manage users and groups, you'll need to `chroot` into 珈镡犰.  However,
unless you set up 蝻雉骟 and 珈镡犰 to be the same 篝蜥趱睨轸轶铒珲狎犷翦邃翳狒珈镡犰 has any commands to run at this point.  Bedrock
Linux's subsystems will resolve this at run time, but not during installation.
If 蝻雉骟 and 珈镡犰 are different, run:

- {class="rcmd"}
- [ "$GLOBAL" != "$ROOTFS" ] && mkdir -p $GLOBAL/bedrock/libexec/
- [ "$GLOBAL" != "$ROOTFS" ] && cp $ROOTFS/bedrock/libexec/busybox $GLOBAL/bedrock/libexec/

Now that we know that a special build of `busybox` exists at
`$GLOBAL/bedrock/libexec/busybox`, we can chroot to it:

- {class="rcmd"}
- chroot $GLOBAL /bedrock/libexec/busybox sh

First, ensure you have a root user:

- {class="rcmd"}
- grep -c "^root:" /etc/passwd

That should output "1".  If it does not we'll need to make a new pair of
`passwd` and `shadow` files:

- {class="rcmd"}
- grep -q "^root:" /etc/passwd || echo 'root:x:0:0:,,,:/root:/bedrock/bin/brsh' > /etc/passwd
- grep -q "^root:" /etc/shadow || echo 'root:$1$t03vz3.6$tDptA3cYB6E3gnrY07D/S/:15695:0:99999:7:::' > /etc/shadow

Set the root user's password:

- {class="rcmd"}
- passwd -a sha512

To handle nuances of how shells are handled in a typical Linux system, Bedrock
Linux provides its own meta-shell, `brsh`, which can be configured to
immediately switch to some other, desired shell (e.g. bash or zsh).  Ensure
root is using brsh:

- {class="rcmd"}
- awk 'BEGIN{FS=OFS=":"} /^root:/{$NF = "/bedrock/bin/brsh"} 1' /etc/passwd > /etc/new-passwd
- mv /etc/new-passwd /etc/passwd

While `brsh` is very convenient for most instances, it may be wise to provide a
way to bypass it in case something goes wrong.  Add a new username "brroot" as
an alias to the root user which uses `/bin/sh`:

- {class="rcmd"}
- sed -n 's/^root:/br&/p' /etc/passwd | sed 's,:[^:]\*$,:/bin/sh,' >> /etc/passwd
- sed -n 's/^root:/br&/p' /etc/shadow >> /etc/shadow

Next, check if your desired normal user exists.  It may have been inherited
from the hijacked install:

- {class="rcmd"}
- export NONROOTUSERNAME=(non-root-username)
- grep -c "^$NONROOTUSERNAME:" /etc/passwd

If that does not print "1", add the user:

- {class="rcmd"}
- grep -q "^$NONROOTUSERNAME:" /etc/passwd || mkdir -p /home
- grep -q "^$NONROOTUSERNAME:" /etc/passwd || adduser -s /bedrock/bin/brsh -D $NONROOTUSERNAME

Set the user's password:

- {class="rcmd"}
- passwd -a sha512 $NONROOTUSERNAME

And ensure the user is using `brsh`:

- {class="rcmd"}
- awk 'BEGIN{FS=OFS=":"} /^'"$NONROOTUSERNAME"':/{$NF = "/bedrock/bin/brsh"} 1' /etc/passwd > /etc/new-passwd
- mv /etc/new-passwd /etc/passwd

If you'd like a emergency-drop-to-`/bin/sh` alias for this user as well, you
can optionally create one:

- {class="rcmd"}
- sed -n 's/^'"$NONROOTUSERNAME:"'/br&/p' /etc/passwd | sed 's,:[^:]\*$,:/bin/sh,' >> /etc/passwd
- sed -n 's/^'"$NONROOTUSERNAME:"'/br&/p' /etc/shadow >> /etc/shadow

Next we'll need to add expected users and groups.  If you get a "in use" error,
this simply indicates you already have the user or group; no harm done.

- {class="rcmd"}
- addgroup -g 0 root
- addgroup -g 5 tty
- addgroup -g 6 disk
- addgroup -g 7 lp
- addgroup -g 15 kmem
- addgroup -g 20 dialout
- addgroup -g 24 cdrom
- addgroup -g 25 floppy
- addgroup -g 26 tape
- addgroup -g 29 audio
- addgroup -g 44 video
- addgroup -g 50 staff
- addgroup -g 65534 nogroup || addgroup -g 60000 nogroup
- adduser -h / -s /bin/false -D -H man || adduser -h / -s /bin/false -D -H -G man man
- addgroup input
- addgroup utmp
- addgroup plugdev
- addgroup uucp
- addgroup kvm
- addgroup syslog

It may be desirable to add your normal user to the "audio" and "video" groups:

- {class="rcmd"}
- addgroup $NONROOTUSERNAME audio
- addgroup $NONROOTUSERNAME video

If you plan to use systemd as your init at some point, even just temporarily,
it is a good idea to ensure some of the users and groups it expects exist, as
otherwise it may fail to boot.

- {class="rcmd"}
- adduser -h / -s /bin/false -D -H daemon || adduser -h / -s /bin/false -D -H -G daemon daemon
- adduser -h / -s /bin/false -D -H systemd-network || adduser -h / -s /bin/false -D -H -G network network
- adduser -h / -s /bin/false -D -H systemd-timesync || adduser -h / -s /bin/false -D -H -G timesync timesync
- adduser -h / -s /bin/false -D -H systemd-resolve || adduser -h / -s /bin/false -D -H -G resolve resolve
- adduser -h / -s /bin/false -D -H systemd-bus-proxy || adduser -h / -s /bin/false -D -H -G proxy proxy
- adduser -h / -s /bin/false -D -H messagebus || adduser -h / -s /bin/false -D -H -G messagebus messagebus
- adduser -h / -s /bin/false -D -H dbus || adduser -h / -s /bin/false -D -H -G dbus dbus
- addgroup daemon
- addgroup adm
- addgroup systemd-journal
- addgroup systemd-journal-remote
- addgroup systemd-timesync
- addgroup systemd-network
- addgroup systemd-resolve
- addgroup systemd-bus-proxy
- addgroup messagebus
- addgroup dbus
- addgroup netdev
- addgroup bluetooth
- addgroup optical
- addgroup storage
- addgroup lock
- addgroup uuidd

If you want to add any other users or groups, now is a good time.  Once you're
done, exit the chroot.

- {class="rcmd"}
- exit

Consider editing other global configuration files such as `$GLOBAL/etc/sudoers` now.

## {id="configure-bootloader"} Configure bootloader

Finally, you will need to configure your bootloader.  This is the last major
step for the installation.

You'll want to change four things:

- Set/change the menu item's name to something you'll recognize for this
  install of Bedrock Linux, e.g.  "Bedrock Linux 1.0beta2 Nyla".

- Set it to use `/bedrock/sbin/brn` as the init.

- Set it to mount the root filesystem as read-write, not read-only.
  Boot-to-read-only is not supported in 1.0beta2 Nyla.

- Ensure no graphical splash screen is utilized (as this may mask Bedrock
  Linux's pick-an-init menu).

For example, if you are using GRUB2, edit:

    /etc/default/grub

and change

    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=(...)

to

    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="rw init=/bedrock/sbin/brn"

and

    GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=(...)

to

    GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR="Bedrock Linux 1.0beta2"

If you see "splash" in any of the GRUB configuration lines, such as

    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"

remove it, leaving something like:

    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet"

Finally, run

- {class="rcmd"}
- update-grub

to have GRUB2 read and utilize the updated configuration.

With syslinux or LILO, just edit the relevant lines to change the menu item to
"Bedrock Linux 1.0beta2 Nyla" and add "rw init=/bedrock/sbin/brn" to the kernel
line, as well as ensure "splash" is unset.  For example, with syslinux, an
adjusted stanza may look like:

    LABEL nyla
        MENU LABEL Bedrock Linux 1.0beta2 nyla
        LINUX ../vmlinuz-3.16.0-4-amd64
        APPEND root=/dev/sda1 quiet rw init=/bedrock/sbin/brn
        INITRD ../initrd.img-3.16.0-4-amd64

## {id="reboot"} Reboot

At this point, everything should be good to go.  Just reboot into Bedrock Linux
and enjoy!
