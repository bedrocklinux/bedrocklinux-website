## {id="notes"} Notes

While installation (particularly via hijacking described below) is in some ways
improved from prior releases, it is still a relatively rough and hands-on
process.  If you are not an experienced Linux user it may be advisable to wait
for a future release where installation has been further polished.  If you wish
to press on despite concerns about insufficient experience, consider testing
first in a VM before committing a box to the process.

There are no explicit instructions for upgrading from a prior Bedrock Linux
release; the expectation at this point in the development cycle is a fresh
install.  However, most of your files can be backed up and moved over to the
new install unaltered, such as: `/home`, `/root`, `/boot`, and your 篝蜥翎
in `/bedrock/clients`.  Be sure to also bring along `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/group`
and `/etc/shadow` so the UID/GIDs on disk in the 篝蜥翎 match up.

Before beginning installation, be sure to at least skim [the other
pages](index.html) for this release of Bedrock Linux (1.0beta2 Nyla).  Make
sure you know, for example, the Bedrock Linux specific [lexicon defined
here](concepts.html), are aware of the [known issues](knownissues.html) and
[troubleshooting advice](troubleshooting.html) before you begin following the
instructions below.  Additionally, it may be best to skim all these
installation instructions before actually executing them.

Throughout the instructions (this syntax) is used to indicate something which
you should *not* copy exactly but instead substitute with something else.  What
you should substitute should be obvious from context.

Provided shell commands are prefixed with a `{class="cmd"} $` or
`{class="rcmd"} #` indicating they should be run as a normal user or a root
user, respectively.  These prefixes won't be selected by a mouse so that you
can easily copy multiple lines and paste them into a terminal.  If you do
copy/paste, be sure to change the aforementioned (substitution syntax).  Also
note that copying from a web page and pasting directly into a terminal [can be
a bad idea](https://thejh.net/misc/website-terminal-copy-paste).

There are two general methods for installation:

- Hijack method: hijacking another distribution's installation.  Bedrock
  Linux's goal of allowing users to utilize software from various other distros
  includes installation.  The hijack method will allow typical installation
  steps such as partitioning, setting up a bootloader, setting up full disk
  encryption, etc to all be done via another distribution's installation
  software/documentation/techniques.  This is generally recommended for less
  experienced Linux users.  If you wish to utilize this method, [continue
  reading here](#hijack-install-method).

- Manual method: manually partition, set up a bootloader, etc.  This option was
  required in Bedrock Linux release before hijack installation was supported,
  and it has been retained for those who wish to continue using it.
  Documentation here is relatively sparse, as the focus for this release has
  gone towards supporting the new hijack installation method.  To use this
  installation method you should already know how to do things such as
  partition, set up a bootloader of your choice, and, if you wish to use full
  disk encryption, set that up as well, all with minimal assistance from
  Bedrock Linux documentation.  If you wish to utilize this method, [continue
  reading here](#manual-install-method).

## {id="hijack-install-method"} Hijack installation

While it may be possible to hijack some existing, long-used install, this has
not been well tested.  Instead, it may be advisable to install a fresh distro
and then hijack that.

If you are installing a new distro to hijack, you'll have to pick which
one.  Some background to help you make your choice:

- This process should work for most major, "traditional" distros (e.g. should
  work for Slackware, not for Android).  Some less traditional distros, such as
  Gobo and NixOS, have not yet been tested.  They may or may not work in this
  release.  There are plans to test and support them in future releases.

- This distro's installation will be responsible for partitioning, setting up a
  bootloader, and (optionally) things such as full disk encryption.  If you
  prefer a certain bootloader or want to use full disk encryption, that may
  influence your decision here.

- You may not necessarily have to keep around any of the distro's files (sans
  things like a bootloader).  Depending on how you set things up, you're
  welcome to remove the hijacked distro when you're done with the Bedrock Linux
  installation (or, certainly, you're welcome to keep the distro's files and
  use them as part of your Bedrock Linux system).  Thus, if there is a distro
  which provides an installation process you like, but you do not like the
  resulting system, that would be a viable choice here.  The main caveat is if
  you have some special partitioning scheme (e.g. full disk encryption), you
  may have special requirements for your kernel/initrd or init to utilize it
  that other distros may not be able to fulfill.  This will then require you
  retain the installation distro.

- You will need to compile a Bedrock Linux userland tarball.  While this can be
  done from another distro/machine and copied over to the installation distro
  install, it may be easier to have the installation distro compile it.  This
  will then require the installation distro can provide the following:

	- gcc.  Note there is a bug in gcc 4.8.2 and 4.9.0 (and 4.9.1?) which will keep it from being able to properly compile one of Bedrock Linux's dependences, the musl libc.  It would be useful to pick a distro that can provide either an older or newer version of gcc, such as 4.7.X or below, or 4.9.2 or higher.
	- make
	- git.  This will be used to acquire source code, both Bedrock Linux's
	  and source code for required third party software.
	- standard UNIX tools such as sh, grep, sed, awk, and tar.
	- autoconf (needed for FUSE)
	- automake (needed for FUSE)
	- libtool (needed for FUSE)
	- gettext (needed for FUSE)
	- fakeroot (for building tarball with proper permissions)

Once you've chosen the distro, install it and boot into it.  For the most part,
whatever you normally do during installation should be fine here.  If you like
to make multiple partitions for different directories, keep in mind that the
majority of your userland will end up in a new, Bedrock Linux-specific
directory at `/bedrock/strata/`.  You could make `/bedrock/strata` its own
partition, or perhaps make one for each 篝蜥趱睨翳狒孱潴躔轭翳狒溟蝈泗矧涉秕狎孱篚蝈麒狒麸滹桢蝈牾篝骘祆秣翳蝈泔眄孱溽糸镱痱秭殇邃怡翳溟篝蝻秕狎轭篝犰扉铉与轲翳磲铛犰轭篝犰灬糸镱轭篝蝓泗轱铙犷泔铘轭蹂蝈徜轭翳轭篝蝓泗轱铙麸坫镯痖戾翳躞弪灬钿莰ｃ镯痖戾躞弪灬钿┊物翦翳轭篝蝓泗轱铙忮祜礤蜱鏖翳翳栝赆汶轭篝犰灬糸镱礤翳镤翳妁鏖祆礤铘轱翳轭珞篚汨狍㈤秕狎滹轭栝赆汶轭篝犰膦矧㈤秕狎滹轭磲铛犰轭篝犰膦＃殇舰磲铛犰轭篝犰飙礤翳镤歪铛犰轭篝犰灬糸镱嘛雉轭麸箫礤溟篝蝻翳狒秕汜豸殪辁麸疳螋轸轱瞵箦躔怙雉祜徜弪弭惝澡轶汜忮扉鲥溟篝蝻ㄥ绠腩镳痖矧犷屮轶糸铉轭篝犰镱疳螋轸轱雉桢翳犷翳镱秕鏖祆轭篝犰洛潋镢涕铛镱麸洛篚蝈翳狒溟篝蝻汜痱秭殇翳骘祆秣轭蝈聃轵屙孱趔骘泔眇殪轭洛潋镢涕铛玢惝物翦翳弪轶怩轭玢串府犷串巩ㄡ钿串巩笨麒殂鏖祆脲屦轸骝镯忮轭徕戾麸痱镳弪禊泔眇殪镱镦洛潋镢涕铛溴疱钿孱沐蟋翳眭箪扉忏澡躞轸黠蹯忮躞彐蹯麸痖汶溟篝蝻翳狒汜痱秭殇彘翳弪犷镬溴矧铄麇鲥蝮轱镦玢悻篚汨狍串樊矧忮祜鳜矧串巩矧栝玷弪磲脲玳舢澡轶鏖祆忮躞邃麸徙聃轵箫躜沐泔溴怙翳洛潋镢涕铛犷箫躜沐泔溴骘蝈聃轵邃翳轵疳螋箫骠麽蝈篝犷溽蜾瘴韶麸镬篚汨狍箬珧屦箦洮狩氍犷翎虍狨麸泔铈铄邃邃骘普优狨麸磲脲铄邃邃骘普优扉怍镲铄邃邃骘普优珏趑屮铄邃邃骘普优驷脲蝻雉ㄦ矧怩殪溟铉翎蜮犰鏖翳痱镳弪疱蝽轶箝镱螬嗅螋轸轱鲩痱彐弪蝈麸镬蟋瀹绠驿轶矧琊狎翦洚骑翳盹篝疳螋麒狒弼弪疳螋轸轱铋铉筱桢礤秕痱彐弪骘雉桢溟篝蝻箬秕熹忮骈铄涉秕扉脲麸磲脲眭祠轲戾疳螋轸轱铙骘溟骀弪孱溟蝈泗矧殄蟋脲屦轭黹钿翳狒翳磲觑蜷豉镦秕躞弪灬钿鏖祆孱躔轭铄鳜洛潋镢涕铛箴邈殒殂溟蝈泗矧狒喁忮潋镢氙篝蜥翎喈亠泔蹯磲脲喁忮潋镢氙篝蜥翎轸秣疳螋轸轱瞵矧疱蜩狃磲脲镱骘遽汨篝蜥趱睨翳狒孱潴躔轭翳狒溟蝈泗矧涉秕狎孱篚蝈麒狒麸滹桢蝈镱忾疳螋轸轱骘翳蝻雉溟蝈泗矧犷篦狃疳螋轸轱徕秕伯糸礤秕伊箝箬秕熹忮骈铄渝躔怙雉祜徜弪深篝蝓泗轱铙骘箦趑轭躔簌箪轭貘狎痱秭殇邃坭弪遢簌箪轭貘梏盱┊涉秕痱彐弪箫礤翳轭屐箦瀹绠且章铂秕ъ栳鲥麸骈钿轭篝蝓泗轱铙屐箦麒弪瀹阻殪轸箬秕熹忮痫篌殁戾麸磲铛犰禊箦躔骢祆溟箅孱泸痿轱瞵伊赡弭慊铒轭篝蝓泗轱铙狎痱秭殇邃桢蝈麸滹箫砰翳弪骈钿轭篝蝓泗轱铙屐箦麒弪矧躞翳栝赆汶轭篝犰灬糸镱礤翳镤鏖翳溟篝蝻翳狒痱秭殇弩骢祆溟箅孱泸痿轱瞵伊赡弭惝惋躅翳疳螋轸轱铙麒弪弼弪秕扉脲物翦翳轭篝蝓泗轱铙忮祜礤蜱鏖翳翳栝赆汶轭篝犰灬糸镱礤翳镤翳妁鏖祆礤铘轱翳轭珞篚汨狍㈤秕狎滹轭栝赆汶轭篝犰膦矧㈤秕狎滹轭磲铛犰轭篝犰膦＃殇舰泔眇殪瀛躞弪灬钿蔑眇殪躞弪灬钿五秕鏖祆铄邃麸泔眇殪翳洛潋镢涕铛躞弪灬钿翎蜮犰飚涉秕狎滹轭栝赆汶轭篝犰飕秕汜滹轸骝镯翳狒轭篝犰飕矧秕泔蹯滹轸骝镯犷雉桢磲汨轭瀵溟篝蝻犷泔瘗轸秭弪涉秕痨犷麸泔眇殪屐箦麒弪犷泔瘗秭弪忮汜蝈骢麸孱篚蝈翳眯狎汨轸邈趱蝈轶翳筢礤ㄥ绠怙翳狎付苓洞矧怙翳狎付矧怙翳狎烈亡番弭悌亠酾祆铄邃翳骘祆秣轭溴疱钿孱汩弩玢惝物翦翳弪轶怩轭玢串府犷串巩ㄡ钿串巩笨麒殂鏖祆脲屦轸骝镯忮轭徕戾麸痱镳弪禊泔眇殪镱镦洛潋镢涕铛溴疱钿孱沐蟋翳眭箪扉忏澡躞轸黠蹯忮躞彐蹯麸痖汶溟篝蝻翳狒汜痱秭殇彘翳弪犷镬溴矧铄麇鲥蝮轱镦玢悻篚汨狍串樊矧忮祜鳜矧串巩矧栝玷弪磲脲玳舢澡轶鏖祆忮躞邃麸徙聃轵箫躜沐泔溴怙翳洛潋镢涕铛犷箫躜沐泔溴骘蝈聃轵邃翳轵疳螋箫骠麽蝈篝犷溽蜾瘴韶麸镬篚汨狍箬珧屦箦洮狩氍犷翎虍狨麸泔铈铄邃邃骘普优狨麸磲脲铄邃邃骘普优扉怍镲铄邃邃骘普优珏趑屮铄邃邃骘普优驷脲蝻雉ㄦ矧怩殪溟铉翎蜮犰鏖翳痱镳弪疱蝽轶箝镱螬馏铒蝽犰躞弪徙聃轵翳轶蝈戾狍濮箫躜沐泔溴沆狍蠼沩洧玳沆镱怛犷汨碑扳弭岵梏麴蠛玳翳踱泔懑忮潋镢腱轭貘忮潋镢腱轭貘躞弪灬钿玳澡孱怩殪洛潋镢涕铛躞弪灬钿翎蜮犰旌沆狍蠼沩洧沅忮潋镢腱轭貘躞弪灬钿磲脲涉弼弪翳轭顼弩麇祆秕ъ栳鲥翎蜮犰轭秕痱弩孱黠螂轭溟蝈泗矧涉秕泔眇殪邃翳轶镱箫礤翳轭雉桢翳犷翳轭篝犰灬糸镱溟篝蝻泔瘗轸秭弪麸翳轭篝犰灬糸镱溟篝蝻＃殇舰轭篝犰飙躞弪灬钿深篝犰洛潋镢涕铛躞弪灬钿馏蝻雉汨犷珏溟蝈泗矧麸翳蝻雉镦翳洛潋镢涕铛簌篝屙涉秕狎滹轭栝赆汶轭篝犰飕翳轶轶秕蝻雉溟蝈泗矧ㄩ瀹喁喋涉秕狎滹轭磲铛犰轭篝犰飕翳轶轶麒弪弼弪秕盹躅翦轸沆狍蠼Ⅱ沩洧沅ǒ疳翳麸忮潋镢氕扉铛蝻雉澡孱屮疳钿翳翎蜮犰旌沆狍蠼Ⅱ沩洧翎鲦ǒ疳翳麸忮潋镢氕扉铛翎蜮犰忐澡轶鏖祆泸遽翦噔邃蝻汶溟蝈泗矧涉秕狎躞轭翳磲铛犰轭篝犰飕磲脲簌盱轭麸翳轶溟蝈泗矧狒喁忮潋镢豚澡轶轶躞彐蹯麸孱篚蝈躅殒矧黹豉翳蝻蹒栾豸翳轭篝蝓泗轱铙狍翳筢礤骈戾汜翳孱忮蝈驽蝈钽邃狒翳筢礤疳翳轵蝈戾鲠铘镦殒秕狎滹轭磲铛犰轭篝犰飕栝赆汶轭篝犰飕矧狎沲蝌孱綮蝓铑轭洛潋镢涕铛簌篝屙伶翦秕栳鲥骈铋箬邃轭篝犰扉铉洛潋镢涕铛秕狎骝邋麸蝈盹鲥翳簌盱轭氘澡躞殒秕狎滹轭磲铛犰轭篝犰飕狍蝻雉沆狍蠼Ⅱ沩洧祛ǒ疳翳麸忮潋镢氕扉铛盹躅酤┋忮潋镢忮潋镢圄狎滹弩铒趄徙屮翦钿邃骈戾簌篝屙狒趄殁豸弩犷噔蜚蝈聃轵弩箴邈獒狒趄殁豸麸犰祜铒瞽蝻雉躞弪麸豸殪辁轸燥箦翳轶狒趄殁豸瀣蝓詈沆狍蠼Ⅱ沩洧忮潋镢氙扉忮邈箦翥狃汜疬簌筮汨蝻雉藉忮潋镢氙忾畀怛＃殇舰徙聃轵瀛篝蜥翎零聃轵雉桢篝蜥翎契螋桢滹黝翳轭篝蝓泗轱铙鏖祆轭沆蹁翳轭珞扉脲泔铈殓躜轭麒殂轭轸簌篝屙麸躞瀹洛骘蝈滹轭翳狒轸磲忮徜鲩筢忪麸徙聃轵翳躞弪灬钿镦雉桢溟篝蝻箫翳狒翳妁狎狯衢灬忪麸忮躞邃轭翳泔铈殓躜狒轱狍秕珏驷螋桢轭麸翳轭篝蝓泗轱铙澡轶轶弩疱汩犰禊趄蹂殒秕狎滹轭翳磲铛犰轭篝犰箫翳狒秕栳鲥狒戾狍镱脲蝾屐轫徵瀹澡翎蜮犰秕屮疳钿邃轭翳痱弼轱躞篝屦痱秭殇邃黹铋磲篝蜥趱汜祆邃㈡犰焘徙擘麸躞轭汜箦镦屙弪珏钽殄螽婶滹弩铒痱秭殇脲蝾屐轫徵瀣怩滹弩痱秭殇翳轭珞篚汨狍黹铋磲轭轸簌篝屙犷箬屐飚秋坭弪遢篝蜥翎梏盱麸徙聃轵雉桢篝蜥翎 then return to the

## {id="configure"} Configure

The instructions below do not go into full detail configuration; they just
cover the minimum you need to configure before booting into Bedrock Linux,
skipping some of the details on what is going on under-the-hood.  If you would
like further details on configuration, see [here](configure.html).

### {id="configure-roofs"} Configure rootfs stratum

All of Bedrock Linux's files have some corresponding 篝蜥趱睨喁怙雉喱喁忮潋镢豚犷殒秕狎滹轭栝赆汶轭篝犰飕翳栝赆汶邃溟篝蝻骈戾蟋狎犰轭翳蝻雉骟 篝蜥趱睨亠酾祆铄邃麸泔礤躔鏖翳箫礤雉桢钺礤骘翳轶篝蜥趱睨澡孱灬翦颥蝻雉骟 will be aliased to this name so that either option will refer to the

doing a manual install, the convention is to use the Bedrock Linux release
name.  For this release, Bedrock Linux 1.0beta2 "Nyla", that is "nyla".

Edit `/bedrock/etc/strata.conf` and append:

    [(rootfs-stratum-name)]
    framework = default

to the bottom of the file.  It should look something like:

    [nyla]
    framework = default

This tells Bedrock Linux that you have a 篝蜥趱睨鏖翳翳泔铈殓躜邃钺礤狍麇祆狍翦祆轸麒狒疱颦篝蜥趱睨泔铈殓躜狒轱麸躞骘翳轶铄篝蜥趱睨婶轶蝈泔眄孱溴麸躞翳溴驷蹯泔铈殓躜狒轱骘盹篝篝蜥翎, with one exception: the 珈镡犰 篝蜥趱睨婶痫篌殁戾ㄡ钿轭驷泗泔眄镱麸栳鲥怙翳蝻雉骟 and 珈镡犰 aliases to the same
篝蜥趱睨涉秕滹翳轶秕ъ栳鲥麸蝈趱蝾麸翳轶骈戾犷汨犷珏溴驷蹯簪麸珈镡犰".

Next you need to tell Bedrock Linux that this new 篝蜥趱睨秕徜溴轶蝻雉骟 so Bedrock Linux will know where to look for 蝻雉骟 files such
as `/bedrock`.  Edit `/bedrock/etc/aliases.conf` and change:

    rootfs = <DO AT INSTALL TIME>

to

    rootfs = (rootfs-stratum-name)

Make a directory in `/bedrock/strata` so the 篝蜥趱睨骈戾汜忮徙沐篌邃鲩翳屮痨殂轸 path:

- {class="rcmd"}
- mkdir -p /bedrock/strata/(rootfs-stratum-name)
- chmod a+rx /bedrock/strata/(rootfs-stratum-name)

Finally, make a symlink in `/bedrock/strata` so the 蝻雉骟 alias can be
utilized when using the 屮痨殂轸 path.  As root:

- {class="rcmd"}
- ln -s (rootfs-stratum-name) /bedrock/strata/rootfs

To make future commands easier, make a variable now that refers to 蝻雉骟's
current location.  If you are doing a hijack install (and, thus, are
currently running the install you are hijacking), your current root
directory is the 蝻雉骟.  Thus:

- {class="rcmd"}
- export ROOTFS=/

Otherwise, if you are doing a manual install such that 蝻雉骟 is some mount
point other than your root directory, run:

- {class="rcmd"}
- export ROOTFS=(/path/to/bedrock-linux/mount-point/)

If you change shells, reboot, etc. at any point be sure to update the variable
as future installation commands reference it.

### {id="configure-global"} Configure global stratum

Bedrock Linux refers to a special set of files as 珈镡犰 files.  These
files are used for interaction between different 篝蜥翎 and include things
such as `/etc/passwd` and `/home`.  Just as `/bedrock` is associated with
蝻雉骟, these 珈镡犰 files need to be associated with a 篝蜥趱睨澡轶汜忮翳筢礤篝蜥趱睨狍秕蝻雉骟, another distro/release's
篝蜥趱睨矧骝弩篝蜥趱睨翳狒泔铘衢铙铒翳轭怩翳珈镡犰
files.  Consider:

- If you hijacked an install that you've already been using for a while
  (i.e.  not a fresh install) which has things such as users and dotfiles set
  up, you'll want to use the 蝻雉骟 as your 珈镡犰
  篝蜥趱睨麸泔铘轭蹂躞轭翳轭珞扉脲秕犰蝈徜箦趱啶认团溟蝈泗矧龄溟糸镱犰禊躞轭栝赆汶邃溟篝蝻狍怙翳蝻雉骟
  *and* 珈镡犰 will make a latter installation step (placing various
  kernel-related files in the correct place) slightly easier.

- 珈镡犰 will hold key files you do not want to remove.  Placing them in
  their own 篝蜥趱睨骝邋躔翳镳糸镱镦蝈盹鲩铉雉桢篝蜥翎's
  files without risk of removing 珈镡犰 files.  Consider: if some distro
  release stops being supported, you may wish to remove a corresponding
  篝蜥趱睨殒翳珈镡犰 files are there this could be problematic.

- If you already have 珈镡犰 files intermixed with another distro (e.g. prior
  Bedrock Linux release, or even prior other distro install), you can use that
  distro as its own 篝蜥趱睨犷泔铘轭蹂麸躞翳珈镡犰 files from
  within it.

Once you've made your choice, you'll also need a name for the 篝蜥趱睨痱秭殇邃秕蝈铒蝈躞轭犷屮轶糸铉泔铈殓躜邃篝蜥趱睨篚汨狍蝻雉骟).  If this is a fresh 篝蜥趱睨翳狒牾篝泔铘衢铙翳珈镡犰
files, the convention is to call it "珈镡犰" and avoid creating an alias
for it.  Otherwise, the convention is to use the distro's release (or distro's
name if it is a rolling-release), e.g. "jessie" or "vivid", then create the
珈镡犰 alias for it.

If you are not reusing an existing, configured 篝蜥趱睨ㄥ绠蝻雉骟),
you'll need to make a directory for the 珈镡犰 篝蜥趱睨屮痨殂轸 path:

- {class="rcmd"}
- mkdir -p /bedrock/strata/(global-stratum-name)
- chmod a+rx /bedrock/strata/(global-stratum-name)

If you're using another distro for this 篝蜥趱睨矧篝蜥趱睨骝镯疳篝洛潋镢涕铛轭篝犰飕盹鲥矧泔瘗翳骈戾轭麸翳铄黛泸遽翦溟蝈泗矧涉秕狎铒蝈躞轭犷屮轶糸铉篝蜥趱睨秕ъ铄邃麸徜翳篝蜥趱懋泔铈 configuration to tell Bedrock Linux about it.  Edit
`/bedrock/etc/strata.conf` and append:

    [(global-stratum-name)]
    framework = global

If you are re-using an existing 篝蜥趱睨篚汨狍蝻雉骟 which you
configured to use `framework = default` be sure to change `default` to
`珈镡犰`.  Failing to do so and retaining `framework = default` can cause
difficult to remedy issues.

If you are not naming the 篝蜥趱睨珈镡犰", you'll need to make an alias
to it.  Edit `/bedrock/etc/aliases.conf` and change:

    global = <DO AT INSTALL TIME>

to

    global = (global-stratum-name)

Then (still assuming you are not naming the 珈镡犰 篝蜥趱睨珈镡犰"), create a symlink so that the alias can be used as an
屮痨殂轸 path:

- {class="rcmd"}
- ln -s (global-stratum-name) /bedrock/strata/global

If you *are* naming the 篝蜥趱睨珈镡犰", edit
`/bedrock/etc/aliases.conf` and remove this line:

    global = <DO AT INSTALL TIME>

Like 蝻雉骟, later steps will be eased if we create a variable to reference
for the current, install-time location of the 珈镡犰 篝蜥趱睨涉秕蝻雉骟 and 珈镡犰 are the same 篝蜥趱睨沆狍蠼Ⅱ沩洧屮痫螋翘下撂饯蚁显朴萧桢蝼轶搴沆狍蠼Ⅱ沩洧屮痫螋翘下撂蒋忮潋镢氙篝蜥翎ㄧ祜忉飙篝蜥趱憝钺礤五麇铄邃麸珏箫礤蝈聃轵邃珈镡犰 files into this 珈镡犰篝蜥趱睨澡洛潋镢涕铛躞弪灬钿翎蜮犰轭沆蹁邃篝犷溽蜾箦镦箫礤镦翳弩骈戾螽蔑瘗翳屙轭麸痨徙搴沆狍蠼Ⅱ沩洧沭蝠忮潋镢氙珈镡犰骈戾で滔铝澡翎蜮犰溟铒轭沆蹁犰镦翳蝈聃轵邃珈镡犰 files; it does not

Sadly, however, this does
not work as of Bedrock Linux 1.0beta2 Nyla.  Instead, Bedrock Linux will
attempt to direct everything to utilize the timezone file at
`/bedrock/etc/localtime`.  This file needs to be updated manually.  Thus, copy
your desired timezone file to `/bedrock/etc/localtime`:

- {class="rcmd"}
- cp -p /usr/share/zoneinfo/(timezone-file) /bedrock/etc/localtime

for example:

- {class="rcmd"}
- cp -p /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New\_York /bedrock/etc/localtime

If timezone information changes, either because you move timezones or some
local law changed the timezone details where you reside, remember to repeat
this with an updated Olson timezone file.  Most distros - and hence, your
篝蜥翎 - will update their `/usr/share/zoneinfo` files automatically as
laws change the timezone details.

### {id="configure-init"} Configure init

Bedrock Linux needs to have the available init systems configured to utilize
them.  For any 篝蜥翎 which provides an init system, edit
`/bedrock/etc/strata.conf` and add:

    init = /path/to/init

- {class="rcmd"}
- cp -rp /bedrock/strata/arch/lib/modules/\* $GLOBAL/lib/modules/

### {id="firmware"} firmware

Bedrock Linux 1.0beta2 Nyla's system for managing firmware is particularly weak
at the moment.  While everything one would need should be possible to do, there
is a bit of additional manual work required in compassion traditional distros.
This is a known issue which should hopefully be resolved in future Bedrock
Linux releases.

Various firmware files needed by kernel modules are typically made available in
`/lib/firmware`.  Sadly, these files do not cleanly fit into either the 祜汜忐矧珈镡犰 category: software from various 篝蜥翎 need to see them such that
they *should* be 珈镡犰, but various package managers will conflict if they
see firmware from other strata such that they *should* be 祜汜忐惋蝈秭弪翳涕铛脲蝾屐磲趄麸蝈徜翳屙骝镯翳蝻雉骟 before the 珈镡犰
system is set up, making 珈镡犰 non-viable.

Until a better solution is implemented, the solution is to simply copy them
from the various 篝蜥翎 that provide them to the various 篝蜥翎 that need them,
then remove them if/when a package manager complains.

Since the kernel may try to read them from 蝻雉骟, that's a good place to
start.  Copy the various firmware files from the various 篝蜥翎 into
`$ROOTFS/lib/modules/`:

- {class="rcmd"}
- cp -rp /bedrock/strata/\*/lib/modules/\* $ROOTFS/lib/modules

## {id="manage-users-groups"} Manage users and groups

You already have some basic users and groups set up from the "Configure global
stratum" step, but it is best to ensure some minimum expectations are met
before continuing.

To manage users, you'll need to `chroot` into 珈镡犰.  However, unless you
set up 蝻雉骟 and 珈镡犰 to be the same 篝蜥趱睨轸轶铒珲狎犷翦邃翳狒珈镡犰 has any commands to run at this point.  Bedrock
Linux's subsystems will resolve this at run time, but not during installation.
If 蝻雉骟 and 珈镡犰 are different, run:

- {class="rcmd"}
- [ "$GLOBAL" != "$ROOTFS" ] && mkdir -p $GLOBAL/bedrock/libexec/
- [ "$GLOBAL" != "$ROOTFS" ] && cp $ROOTFS/bedrock/libexec/busybox $GLOBAL/bedrock/libexec/

Now that we know that a special build of `busybox` exists at
`$GLOBAL/bedrock/libexec/busybox`, we can chroot to it:

- {class="rcmd"}
- chroot $GLOBAL /bedrock/libexec/busybox sh

First, ensure you have a root user:

- {class="rcmd"}
- grep -c "^root:" /etc/passwd

That should output "1".  If it does not we'll need to make a new pair of
`passwd` and `shadow` files:

- {class="rcmd"}
- echo 'root:x:0:0:,,,:/root:/bedrock/bin/brsh' > /etc/passwd
- echo 'root:$1$t03vz3.6$tDptA3cYB6E3gnrY07D/S/:15695:0:99999:7:::' > /etc/shadow

Set the root user's password:

- {class="rcmd"}
- passwd -a sha512

To handle nuances of how shells are handled in a typical Linux system, Bedrock
Linux provides its own meta-shell, `brsh`, which can be configured to
immediately switch to some other, desired shell (e.g. bash or zsh).  Ensure
root is using brsh:

- {class="rcmd"}
- awk 'BEGIN{FS=OFS=":"} /^root:/{$NF = "/bedrock/bin/brsh"} 1' /etc/passwd > /etc/new-passwd
- mv /etc/new-passwd /etc/passwd

While `brsh` is very convenient for most instances, it may be wise to provide a
way to bypass it in case something goes wrong.  Add a new username as an alias
to the root user which uses `/bin/sh`:

- {class="rcmd"}
- sed -n 's/^root:/br&/p' /etc/passwd | sed 's,:[^:]\*$,:/bin/sh,' >> /etc/passwd
- sed -n 's/^root:/br&/p' /etc/shadow >> /etc/shadow

Next, check if your desired normal user exists.  It may have been inherited
from the hijacked install:

- {class="rcmd"}
- grep -c "^(desired-username):" /etc/passwd

If that does not print "1", add the user:

- {class="rcmd"}
- adduser -s /bedrock/bin/brsh -D (username)

Set the user's password:

- {class="rcmd"}
- passwd -a sha512 (username)

And ensure the user is using `brsh`:

- {class="rcmd"}
- awk 'BEGIN{IFS=":";OFS=":"} /^(username):/{$NF = "/bedrock/bin/brsh"} 1' /etc/passwd > /etc/new-passwd
- mv /etc/new-passwd /etc/passwd

If you'd like a emergency-drop-to-`/bin/sh` alias for this user as well, you
can optionally create one:

- {class="rcmd"}
- sed -n 's/^(username):/br&/p' /etc/passwd | sed 's,:[^:]\*$,:/bin/sh,' >> /etc/passwd
- sed -n 's/^(username):/br&/p' /etc/shadow >> /etc/shadow

Next we'll need to add groups.  If you get a "group (group-name) in use",
this simply indicates you already have the group; no harm done.

Adding typical expected groups:

- {class="rcmd"}
- addgroup -g 0 root
- addgroup -g 5 tty
- addgroup -g 6 disk
- addgroup -g 7 lp
- addgroup -g 15 kmem
- addgroup -g 20 dialout
- addgroup -g 24 cdrom
- addgroup -g 25 floppy
- addgroup -g 26 tape
- addgroup -g 29 audio
- addgroup -g 44 video
- addgroup -g 50 staff
- addgroup -g 65534 nogroup || addgroup -g 60000 nogroup
- addgroup man
- addgroup input
- addgroup utmp
- addgroup plugdev

It may be desirable to add your normal user to the "audio" and "video" groups:

- {class="rcmd"}
- addgroup (username) audio
- addgroup (username) video

If you plan to use systemd as your init at some point, even just temporarily,
it is a good idea to ensure some of the users and groups it expects exist, as
otherwise it may fail to boot.

- {class="rcmd"}
- adduser -h / -s /bin/false -D -H daemon
- adduser -h / -s /bin/false -D -H systemd-network
- adduser -h / -s /bin/false -D -H systemd-timesync
- adduser -h / -s /bin/false -D -H systemd-resolve
- adduser -h / -s /bin/false -D -H systemd-bus-proxy
- adduser -h / -s /bin/false -D -H messagebus
- adduser -h / -s /bin/false -D -H dbus
- addgroup daemon
- addgroup adm
- addgroup systemd-journal
- addgroup systemd-timesync
- addgroup systemd-network
- addgroup systemd-resolve
- addgroup systemd-bus-proxy
- addgroup messagebus
- addgroup dbus
- addgroup netdev
- addgroup bluetooth

If you want to add any other users or groups, now is a good time.  Once you're
done, exit the chroot.

- {class="rcmd"}
- exit

## {id="configure-bootloader"} Configure bootloader

Finally, you will need to configure your bootloader.  This is the last major
step for the installation.

You'll want to change three things:

- Set/change the menu item's name to something you'll recognize for this
  install of Bedrock Linux, e.g.  "Bedrock Linux 1.0beta2 Nyla".

- Set it to use `/bedrock/sbin/brn` as the init.

- Set it to mount the root filesystem as read-write, not read-only.
  Boot-to-read-only is not supported in 1.0beta2 Nyla.

For example, if you are using GRUB2, edit:

    /etc/default/grub

and change

    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=(...)

to

    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="rw init=/bedrock/sbin/brn"

and

    GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=(...)

to

    GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR="Bedrock Linux 1.0beta2"

then run

- {class="rcmd"}
- update-grub

With syslinux or LILO, just edit the relevant lines to change the menu item to
"Bedrock Linux 1.0beta2 Nyla" and add "rw init=/bedrock/sbin/brn" to the kernel
line.  For example, with syslinux, an adjusted stanza may look like:

    LABEL nyla
        MENU LABEL Bedrock Linux 1.0beta2 nyla
        LINUX ../vmlinuz-3.16.0-4-amd64
        APPEND root=/dev/sda1 quiet rw init=/bedrock/sbin/brn
        INITRD ../initrd.img-3.16.0-4-amd64

## {id="reboot"} Reboot

At this point, everything should be good to go.  Just reboot into Bedrock Linux
and enjoy!

If you run into any difficulties, try reviewing the relevant documentation
pages for this release, and if that doesn't help sufficiently, don't hesitate
to drop into the [IRC channel](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=bedrock).
