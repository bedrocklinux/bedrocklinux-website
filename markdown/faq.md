## {id="what\_is\_bedrock"} What is Bedrock Linux?

See the Introduction to [Bedrock](introduction.html).

## {id="how\_bedrock\_work"} How does Bedrock Linux Work?

The exact details may change drastically from release-to-release, but the
general concept is explained [here](introduction.html#concepts).

## {id="why\_use\_bedrock"} Why should I use Bedrock?

- If you would like features or packages available in Linux distributions, but
not all available in the same Linux distribution at the same time. For example,
if you would like your system to be mostly stable and unchanging, like Debian
or a Red Hat Enterprise Linux clone, but would like access to cutting-edge
packages from Arch, Bedrock Linux can provide this simultaneously and
transparently.
- If you would like to have access to other Linux distributions readily
available for purposes other than access to their functionality. For example,
if you regularly assist people who use a variety of Linux distributions and
would like to be able to test possible solutions on your own box without using
virtual machines.
- If you have issues with packages from Linux distributions that are unique to
that distribution and would rather simply use another distribution's package
for this specific issue than debug the root of the problem.
- If you want a toy with which to play.

## {id="why\_not\_use\_bedrock"} Why should I not use Bedrock?

- If you are happy with all of the functionality provided by another Linux
distribution, and you have no interest in features it does not provide, it
would likely be best to simply use that other Linux distribution.
- If you value stability/reliability, note that while this is a priority for
Bedrock Linux, Bedrock Linux is still largely new and untested; a
tried-and-true stable/reliable Linux distribution such as Debian or a Red Hat
Enterprise Linux clone would likely be better suited.
- If you value security, note that Bedrock Linux probably has the highest
attack surface of just about any Linux distribution, mostly because its attack
surface is the sum of the attack surfaces of just about every other Linux
distribution combined. While steps can be taken to alleviate this to some
degree, ultimately, a locked-down Bedrock Linux can never truly reach the
security offered by a locked-down standard Linux distribution.

## {id="contribute"} How can I contribute?

- Pop into [IRC](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=bedrock) and ask around.
- Take a look at the
  [issues](https://github.com/bedrocklinux/bedrocklinux-userland/issues) and,
  if you feel you can tackle something, mention it in the issue tracker or
  discuss it with "paradigm" in
  [IRC](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=bedrock).  Or make a new issue if
  you have an idea.
- There is always a need to improve the documentation.  For example, you could
  add instructions for setting up an obscure distro as a 沆殄铘 Bedrock Linux,
  or something as simple as fixing typos.  Once you have something to submit,
  stop by the [website git
  repo](https://github.com/bedrocklinux/bedrocklinux-website).

## {id="vs\_virtual\_machine"} How is this different from/preferable to using a virtual machine?

Bedrock Linux's functionality differs from virtual machines in three key ways:

- Bedrock's ability to access programs from other Linux distributions is
largely transparent once set up. One can, for example, have a RSS feed reader
from one Linux distribution open a link in a browser in another Linux
distribution, all running in an X11 server from a third Linux distribution.
This all happens transparently; it all feels like one single cohesive Linux
distribution. Virtual machines cannot do this type of transparency nearly as
well.
- Bedrock's ability to access programs from other Linux distributions has
extremely minimal overhead as compared to virtual machines. This is especially
true with respect to 3D/video acceleration, which "just works" (assuming no
proprietary driver issues) as well as it does in a normal Linux distribution.
Such things typically do not work very well at all in virtual machines.
- Bedrock, by its very design, interweaves other Linux distributions together;
it ensures they share quite a bit. This means if there is a security
vulnerability in one of the 沆殄铘簋翳弪轶扉趑戾麸篝镳轸骝镯徭驽泗轭翳蝈篝镦翳簌篝屙珠螋踽磲汨轭弩怡翳彘鲥蝙溴箝珙筢钿怙翳沆殄铘簋篚汨翳狒犷狒翎汶镱镱镦翳屙鏖祆栳鲥溟骀殂蹯糸礤痱镳徵狒轭麸雉桢蝮＃殇舰鲶苓泔铘衢铄颌蕊轶翳轶溟骀弪孱骝镯痱彐弪徕戾麸泔铘衢铄蝮娘汶弪特茂橡孱众弭悌蔑铘衢铄蝮泔铘衢翳轭珞澡妁瘐蝠矬彐蹯禊脲屦翳泔铘衢铄箫骠麽蝈骝镯轭翦蜥泗轭鏖翳翳蝈篝镦翳簌篝屙澡轶栳铛礤蝻躞忮铄骈趔涉箫礤翳轭顼弩黩镱犷轭铒沐铘怩矧磲扉汩秕狒翎汶弪翳溽磲珏滹铄轶蝈篝蜷泗邃麸翳泔铘衢铄虍语骠麽蝈轭翳泔铘衢铄轶灬蜱屐箦戽篚骀殂殄铘犷汜忮遽箝禊磲溴麸蝓镱鲠蜷弭镦涕铛溟篝蜷怩糸镱鏖翳秕黠蝌徕秕翳轭珞泔铈扉泗轭绠涉镱栳犷镬溴溟篝蜷怩糸镱篚汨狍胰盘沆镱怩麽铘铄麇鲥蝮轱镦箫礤箫骠麽蝈轸泔蹯忮痱秭殇邃鲩泔铘衢铄虍蕊麇鲥颥泔铘衢铄蝮栳鲥溟筢漩犷翎珏狍麇祆澡轭珞鏖翳轭泔铘衢铄蝮狎脲痿骝镯轭翦蜥泗轭鏖翳遽汨雉桢虍骑翳轭珞麒殂蝓狍篝犷洵犰镱箦蝣殂弩篚汨狍麇箦蝣弪扉脲狃徙桢犷铉轭翳轶轶铒痱镡戾懋蕊麇鲥颥雉桢箫骠麽蝈轶轭翦钿邃麸泔屮轶鏖翳扉脲箫骠麽蝈蔑铘衢铋铉翳轭珞篚汨狍囗脘轵犷囹礓轵轭箦疳蜥翦泔铘衢铄蝮黠蹯箝珙殒殂犷綮蝈漉沐翳忮铄骈镦遽汨渝蝣殂弩篚汨狍娘汶弪汜忮躞邃麸泸遽翦麒狒狎彐驽泗轹屐鲥蝙痫螋徕戾疳汶徵弩蕊麇鲥颥箫礤镱栳麸滹箫礤黠螂麸泸遽翦翳弩疳汶徵弩项汜铑雉箝眇禊珧徕溴矧翎虍琥骝镯翳蝈痫箝麸蜷弩镦雉桢涕铛溟篝蜷怩糸镱蟋潋镳翳屙轭泔铘衢铄犷屮疱泗翳屙麸黠螂阻弪泔铘衢铄蝮狎躞彐蹯镱轶沐螋衢铎孱泔躜徵邃麸躞翳屙蕊麇鲥颥镱汜铑雉忮蝈犰轶糸汜祆屮疱泗邃麸泔铘衢弼弪翳轭轭溴疱钿孱綮阻狒盹篝涕铛溟篝蜷怩糸镱滹轶痱秭殇箫骠麽蝈翳狒汜轭翦蜥泗钺糸鲥禊骘麒孱翳狒轶躞彐蹯洛潋镢涕铛轶铒溟骀弪孱桢蝈泔钽屦趱犰禊骝镯雉桢磲觑溟篝蜷怩糸镱螽阻狒磲脲洛潋镢涕铛躅轳蹂轶翳狒翳箫骠麽蝈轸汜轭篝犰钺糸鲥禊轶痱秭殇邃骝镯鲥蝙灬蜱鲠蜷弭镦箫躜沐螽涉镱麽铘麸躞囗脘轵骝镯镱溟篝蜷怩糸镱犷囹礓轵骝镯犷雉桢颥骘麒狒弼弪蝈狍镱洛潋镢涕铛骘翳盹篝疳螋汜磲脲翳轶栳痧孱盹蝈蝈犰轶糸屮犴痨黠蹯忮豸殪辁轭矧骝镯镱溟篝蜷怩糸镱犷鏖钿秣磲钺珏矧溴箅麸孱鲩蝻铐孱骝镯犷雉桢铄轸桢轶顼镤犰镱瀣翳妁铄邃麸轭翦蜥泗怩翳弪泔蹯忮戾玳糸磲翦蝈狍镱麸麽铘翳屙骝镯溟骀弪孱溟篝蜷怩糸镱螽渝翳泔眇辁篝矧坭弪遢ㄨ趑鸷忮潋镢腱轭貘矧绡轭趄镤蹉糸镱梏盱ｒ遽爝黠蜢洎骘屮犴痨瀹蔑铘衢铄蝮犷洛潋镢涕铛栳鲥鲥蝙溟骀弪孱顼犰犷顼徕秕翳屙怡灬蜱屐溟骀弪孱礤犷螽澡赭狎铒轭泔眇弭轸轱轭犷麽轭驷泗镱泔蹯蝓洛潋镢涕铛轭泔铘衢铄颥矧蝓泔铘衢铄蝮镱麸镦洛潋镢涕铛铒溟骀弪孱翳犷犷雉桢溟篝蜷怩糸镱＃殇舰麒孱苓蝈戾狍澧阻孱鏖祆ひ盘帕优忮蝈戾狍邃涉翳弪轶犷弩糸磲翦骘蝈戾狍瀣轸鏖祆忮篝狒邃轭翳轭溴疳珏骘翳箴邈殒殂蝈戾狍瀹涉铒衄翳孱轸鏖祆忮蝈戾狍邃麒孱轸轶滹铄＃殇舰麒苓钺礤阻翳狒钺礤洛潋镢涕铛滹弩铒滹鲥蝙眭汨怡轸箦戽蜥翳弪轸轶翳骘躅溽糸镱躔镱麒殂雉桢涕铛溟篝蜷怩糸镱狎痨徙邃深轸獒殇遽骘钺礤麇蝈轭翦铘镱蝈骒邈糸铉翳轶驷泗萧桢痱镳矬邃钺礤轭沆蹁邃⑵秕钿狒轱涕铛⑵蜥礤涕铛犷⒂汜骀镬溟铉涕铛澡钺礤汨矬孱栳铒翳轭麸滹鏖翳翳翦戾鲩箝镱箬秣澡旗轭趔麸铄螵＃殇舰蝈戾狍遘哳犴弩阻弪滹翳蝈戾狍钺礤泔礤骝镯领镦翳洛潋镢涕铛蝈戾狍弩狎钺礤徭翦汨狎徙翦蝮骝镯翳伍汶屐镤屣翦戾鲩箝镱痱镧蜥瘤狒狎澡提篝灵洛钿弪＃殇舰簌篝屙苓蝈聃轵屙孱趔阻狒狎翳簌篝屙蝈聃轵屙孱趔澡簌篝屙蝈聃轵屙孱趔狎扉篝邃轭翳箴邈殒殂疳珏骘遽汨蝈戾狍瀹澡轶轶滹铄轭汜箦汨犷珏忮赭邋鲥蝮轱铙犰翦翳簌篝屙蝈聃轵屙孱趔澡簌篝屙蝈聃轵屙孱趔骘翳轭轸獒犰痂汜忮骘躅坭弪遢ㄨ趑鸷忮潋镢腱轭貘矧绡碑搬祓栳悲簌篝屙蝈聃轵屙孱趔梏盱┊＃殇舰麒苓秣钴咪轶趄铫阻滹弩翳轶铄邃麸忮轸秣溟篝蜷怩糸镱骑眭汨镦洛潋镢涕铛溴鲥祜痦孱衄轸麽箝眇禊箦镦筱蜷痿镱麸镦腻忾犷婶忮汜礤狃疳蝈铘徭翦盹铘梵镦躞轭轸翳狒翳弪黠蹯忮铛礅弪镦忮铄骈趔麸磲脲翳轶轸秣涕铛溟篝蜷怩糸镱涉秕滹铒骈钿犷鲠祯轭翳轸屙扉篝邃桢蝈秕蝈盹蝈翳犷麇煦镯麸趄麸躞翳洛潋镢涕铛豸殪轸殄镱麸镦犷雉桢溟篝蜷怩糸镱澡忉箦溟篝蜷怩糸镱箬秕熹蝈聃轵黹铋磲磲轭翦钺钽秭弪祜铉疱蜷镤镦糸礤侦糸磲翦禊弼孱祜铉翦蝽篚痧矧翦涕铛溟篝蜷怩糸镱鏖祆祜箦篚痧矧犷栳鲥麸忮躔珧徜邃矧蝈痨徙邃弼孱趱犰禊项镦翳徜鲠铘徵弩镦洛潋镢涕铛轶翳狒翳弩溟篝蝻躔珧徜箝趱狒轱铙汜忮箝珙殒殂犷綮戾篌疳轭骢麒孱翳溟篝蝻轶沆殄铘; however, this advantage is not
  available for the base itself. If the base is made to be as minimal as
  possible, this should decrease the amount of things that need to be updated
  and maintained. As Bedrock Linux approaches maturity, this could
  theoretically be brought down to perhaps one or two executables other than
  the Linux kernel itself. It is difficult to properly express just how nice it
  is to never worry about how a major change to how things work under the hood
  of your Linux distribution could possibly take down your system, as the
  vitals of the system remain relatively static.
- The base distribution is effectively entirely overhead. Ideally any resource
  usage (disk space, RAM, CPU, etc) should be minimized. Most major
  distributions available are far larger than necessary as a base on which
  other distros should be placed as Bedrock Linux 沆殄铘簋犷盹篝黹铋磲溟篝蜷怩糸镱麇蝈骘躅麸灬汶驽狒躜弩洛潋镢黠蹯铄邃ㄡ翳妁麇蝈轭翦钿邃麸忮孱糸蝈禊黹铋磲飕蜥翳弪翳犷翳忉箝骘骢祆忪秣溴箅麸鸠箦蝣弪弭悌澡轶轶疳螋殂蹯狎禊轫痫螋犷镱蝈箫躜沐扉黹翦溴鲩沐蟋篚汨狍劣沼佩忻蟋麒弪洛潋镢涕铛遽蜢溴鲥祜痦孱犷躞徵麸镫痨徙瀹王汨镦麒狒洛潋镢涕铛铄邃麸滹麸痱镳弪禊豸殪辁沆殄铘簋蝈聃轵弩溟蝈泗泔铘蝻秭弪脲骈戾蟋篚汨狍弭惘痱镦殪瀹阻殪磲铢涕铛溟篝蜷怩糸镱滹镦驽礤犷麸痱镳弪禊蝈盹鲥轭溟鲩漉犰骈戾骝镯翳疳汶徵磲钺珏颛泔铘蝻飕篚汨狍豸殪辁轭漯腌溟鲥螋狍翳铛礅弪镦骈戾麒殂铄邃翳轶趄遽繇孱珧秣翳徜鲠铘徵弩镦躞轭犷屮轶糸铉溟篝蜷怩糸镱箬蜷铍王汨镦麒狒洛潋镢涕铛铄邃麸滹麸痱镳弪禊豸殪辁沆殄铘簋蝈聃轵弩溟蝈泗泔铘蝻秭弪麒狒栳痧孱漉蜷铉怙雉骑屮犴痨瀣殒镱黠蹯扉脲麸忮徕戾麸汨镲箦麒殂溴鲩沐磲钺珏麸躞骝镯麒殂沆殄铘, special
  functionality must be built into the boot process to properly handle deciding
  which device manager to call when, if any. Attempting to integrate such
  functionality into existing boot systems is not an appealing task when a
  (very simple) home-grown init could suffice instead.

## {id="on\_which\_distro"} On which distribution is Bedrock Linux based?

Bedrock Linux is not based on or an offshoot of any other Linux distribution;
it was written "from scratch." It has unusual twin goals of needing to be as
minimal as possible while supporting the features necessary for a full-blown
desktop. Rather than attempting to tweak an existing distribution into such a
shape a new one was made from the ground up.

## {id="overly-ambitious"} This sounds overly-ambitious. Do you really think you can pull this off?

An argument could be made either way if Bedrock Linux was still in the planning
stages, prior to any functional release, but since Bedrock Linux was publicly
announced along with a functional (if unpolished) alpha: yes. Not only is it
possible, it has been done, and the necessities for you to see this for
yourself have been made available if you don't want to take my word for it.
Much work needs to be done such as polish and the addition of many features,
but the core idea has been proven quite definitively to work.

## {id="other-os"} What about Bedrock BSD or Bedrock Android or Bedrock Something-Else?

It should be noted that no other operating system family has such a disparate
variety of userlands which all run on the same kernel.  Bedrock Linux's
strengths wouldn't be nearly as beneficial anywhere else.  Attempting to do
something such as Bedrock Linux will inherently require leveraging
operating-system-specific tools, and so it may require a fair bit of additional
research to port Bedrock Linux's tools to another platform.
Bedrock Linux is still under heavily development and changes quite a bit
between releases.  It may be best to first wait for Bedrock Linux to settle on
one strategy before putting the efforts to port it elsewhere to avoid wasted effort.

BSD:

- Porting Bedrock Linux to one or more of the BSD operating systems may be
possible.
- Differences in things such as chroot(), namespaces, cgroup, etc may
make it take a fair bit of work.
- The Bedrock Linux FUSE utilites may "just work" on the BSDs.

Traditional-Linux-and-Android:

- Android's utilities may be dependent on Android's patches to the Linux
  kernel.  However, "traditional" Linux programs seem to run fine on the
  Android kernel.  Thus, any port of Bedrock Linux to android would likely
  require an Android kernel to be used.

- The Android file system layout is significantly different from traditional
  Linux distributions.  PATH and bind-mount system changes may be required.

- Android does some unusual things with its UID/GIDs.  For example, does not
  seem to be a UID-username map at /etc/passwd as one would expect from other
  Linux-based operating systems.  UID namespaces and brc-style translation
  programs may be necessary.

Android-on-Android:

- This may be possible.  Most of the issues mentioned for the other platforms
  are unlikely to happen here.

Windows:

- The low-level differences between Windows and Linux are quite significant,
  and thus the possibility does not seem promising; however, no serious
  investigation has been done to confirm this.

OSX:

- No investigation has been done into porting Bedrock Linux to OSX.
- If the BSDs look promising, at least Darwin could be possible.
